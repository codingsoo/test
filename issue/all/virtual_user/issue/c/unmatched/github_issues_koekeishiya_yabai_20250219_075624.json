Can't you just not utilise the desktop; what's the difference?\r\n\r\nCreating and managing an invisible window on each space is not actually as trivial as you make it seem, and complexity like this quickly snowballs if we are to support weird quirks (not just this one in particular, but a line has to be drawn at some point).\r\n\r\nThere are also other issues such as the user manipulating spaces through either mission-control or alternative software that we have no way of interacting with, thus, making our invisible window solution go out of sync. You can argue that this is an edge-case, but my point is simply that for the software to be robust and work well in a consistent manner, such solutions are not something I opt to implement without a very good reason."
