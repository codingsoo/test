You are running version 2.8.11.2\n```\n\nWould it be possible to relax this restriction? It makes builds not work on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS. If not, I can go to using a commit number before the CMake change, but that's not ideal.\n",

        "body": "Yep, I know I broke Travis builds for the moment but I cannot wait any longer. 2.8.12 brought important features that I'll be using in the coming weeks. The current version is 3.2.2, so it's not exactly bleeding edge. That Travis runs such ancient software is frankly on them at this point.\n\nThere are also rumors (travis-ci/travis-ci#3480) that there's a PPA that might work while we wait for them to update to 14.04. When time permits I'll push a container-based Travis setup to master.\n"
