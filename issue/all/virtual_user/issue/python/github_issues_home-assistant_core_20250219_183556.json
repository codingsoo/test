    "body": "I have a pi connected to my garage door opener. I am using a command line switch option to open/close my garage door. I am using the same command to both open and close the door, because all it does is turn on a relay for a few seconds and then back off. Would it be possible to have just a push button with one command option. Then maybe in history just show an event and not lable them as on/off?\n",

I currently have a command_switch that executes the same command at oncmd and offcmd, but the state can be out of sync offcourse.\n"
