A child process (at least on Windows) started from cmd.exe is not supposed to be killed when the parent process receives a Ctrl-C.\r\n\r\nI work from command line all the time, and start Code there. Ctrl-C killing the editor is not a great experience for me."

        "body": "Depends on whether the child process shares the console with the parent cmd process or not.\r\n- For child console process that shares console, Ctrl-C would likely kill the running child process;\r\n- For child GUI process that does not have a console at all, Ctrl-C on the parent cmd process should have no impact on it."

And I guess that is why nobody complains about this issue. I was not aware of this script as I never allow programs to update PATH.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, I figure out that \"start **/b** <path-to-code.exe>\" also works, which basically sets CREATE_NEW_PROCESS_GROUP and thus the new process won't receive Ctrl-C targeting the original group."
