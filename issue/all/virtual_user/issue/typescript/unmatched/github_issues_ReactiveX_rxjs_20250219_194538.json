        "body": "Well spotted! Thanks for that. So the issue occurs when the code example is labeled as javascript code,\r\n\r\ne.g. \r\n```markdown\r\n```javascript\r\nimport { Observable } from 'rxjs';\r\n\r\nconst observable = new Observable(subscriber => {\r\n  subscriber.next(1);\r\n  subscriber.next(2);\r\n  subscriber.next(3);\r\n  setTimeout(() => {\r\n    subscriber.next(4);\r\n    subscriber.complete();\r\n  }, 1000);\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nsuch examples will produce a js stackblitz.\r\n\r\nWhat we basically need to do is replace those javascript hightlighting with ts. AFAIK most of the examples uses typescript so it should be quite safe to replace javascript with typescript here, but it might break some of the examples"
