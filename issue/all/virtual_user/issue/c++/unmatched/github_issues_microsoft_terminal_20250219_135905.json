Move cursor all the way to the left of the screen and start dragging to highlight the text on that row.\r\n\r\n# Expected behavior\r\n\r\nIt starts highlighting the row you are on (the text).  This is similar to putty, cmd, and powershell outside of terminal.\r\n\r\n# Actual behavior\r\n\r\nThe row you are on is not highlighted.  You must click on the first character of the row, not to the left of it.\r\n\r\nThis requires for more precise highlighting to avoid missing what you want to copy and is far slower.\r\n",
