If so, how can I \r\ncreate my own roads rather than randomly generated roads?\r\nThanks!\r\n",

As a hack to get rid of this message you can add a CarlaMapGenerator somewhere far where is not visible, it will create the road map so the controllers are happy.\r\n\r\nNow if you want the autopilot to work (depending on how complex is your road layout), you can create way-points with our RoutePlanner."

Once I move the playerstart into my own city range, the controller fails\r\nimmediately. \r\n"

If this is true for your model you could either delete your simple collision and generate one manually yourself (Most efficient) or, in the details panel of the mesh, under collision, change collision complexity to \"Use Complex Collision as Simple\" this way it will use all the geometry of the model as collision (This option is a bit more costly but will probably work right away).
