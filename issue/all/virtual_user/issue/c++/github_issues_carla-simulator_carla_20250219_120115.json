For our PID do not use the target velocity itself, rather we use the **error** from our current velocity and the target velocity we want to reach. Then, it's divided by the target velocity to make the error a bit smaller, which helps reducing the oscillations when the PID is close to 0.\r\n\r\nIt will work with current_velocity - target_velocity as well, we just chose that particular formula because we had some issues tuning our PID and this solution helped us.

    "body": "Hi CARLA team,\r\n\r\nI have a few question about the model and maps dimensions.\r\n\r\n1. Based on some previous issues, I knew that that the pixel density is 0.1643 m/pixel. #262 . Can I use this to calculate the distance traveled by measuring the pixels traveled?\r\n\r\n2. Since I am interested in how far away the vehicle is from the intersection, could you give some information about the dimensions( Height, Width and Length) of both vehicles (Mustang and Model 3)? I am assuming that the GPS info of the vehicle is always located at the center of the vehicle according to your documentation.\r\n\r\n3. How to measure the dimension(actual lenght) of both maps? Could you let me know what is size of maps in the unit of pixel so that I can calculate the length on my own? \r\n\r\n4. If I want to make the distance to intersection in town 1 and town 2 the same, should I use the same pixel and node density? Also, what is the dimensions of map town 2?\r\n\r\nI greatly appreciate every effort of your development team.\r\n\r\nSincerely,",

Can I use this to calculate the distance traveled by measuring the pixels traveled?\r\n\r\nI think it should do the job.\r\nBut you have the exact car positions each frame. So I think a more accurate solution should be adding each frame the distance between the old frame and the current frame.\r\n\r\n> 2.

I am assuming that the GPS info of the vehicle is always located at the center of the vehicle according to your documentation.\r\n\r\nWe provide the bounding box extent so you can calculate the bounding box of each vehicle. Take a look at these old issues: #64 #314.\r\n\r\n> 3. How to measure the dimension(actual lenght) of both maps? Could you let me know what is size of maps in the unit of pixel so that I can calculate the length on my own?\r\n\r\nYou can open the Unreal Engine editor and measure it. @TheNihilisticRobot just made it for you (in m).\r\n```\r\nTown 1 - 410,68 x 344,26\r\nTown 2 - 205,59 x 204,48\r\n```\r\n\r\n> 4 If I want to make the distance to intersection in town 1 and town 2 the same, should I use the same pixel and node density?
