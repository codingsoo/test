The code will update the Date Picker and my Text output when writing a valid date and leaving the text field, this is normal behavior. However, I want to change the Text based on my selection of Date picker. I have tried binding to date and value. both don't reflect the selection I have made.\r\n\r\nI have checked the documentation on the site and there is nothing on how to handle binding beyond what I am doing.\r\n\r\nAm I missing something or this is a bug? for now I am marking this as a Question it is very likely that I am missing something obvious.\r\nPlease help.",

Had you bound it to a boolean variable it would have been inferred without a compilation error. We knew about this potential breaking change, that's why we bumped the minor version. See #206"
