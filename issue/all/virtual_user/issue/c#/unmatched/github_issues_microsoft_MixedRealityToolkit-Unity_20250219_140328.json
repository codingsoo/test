    "body": "Visual Studio builds are successful on the 5.4 but seem to be failing if the solution is being built from 5.5 beta version of Unity via WiFi deploy. It doesn't throw any error but says \"remote device is taking too long to respond\" and fails eventually. I migrated the 5.5 project to the stable Unity version(5.4) and built the VS solution and it deploys successfully like they used to originally. It's kind of annoying to switch between the versions because Holographic Remoting makes life so much easier and the scenes from 5.5 can't be opened in 5.4 coz of different versions. I'm assuming this is a Unity issue since it's in Beta,  Is this a known issue or am I doing something wrong?\n",

I've no clue why my project doesn't build. Do builds fail if the app is heavy? I'm currently using couple of heavy mesh(about 70mb) models in my project. \n"
