      "title": "Is it possible to createServer without waiting to finish hash checks?",
      "body": "F.e. if 10 GB movie is already downloaded, it takes almost a minute to hash torrent and only then i can `torrent. createServer`. If it's a new torrent I can start playback in 10 seconds so it's faster to delete files and start over.\r\nWould it be possible to start `createServer` while hashing is still in progress?"

      "System must maintain ability to distinguish between complete and incomplete downloads",
      "Method must be available to handle previously downloaded files differently from new downloads",
      "State persistence across application restarts must be supported"

    "initial_question": {
      "title": "When seeding a file/folder from disk, don't perform extra copy to /tmp",
      "body": "Hi !\n\nIf I want to seed a file from (just an example) _/home/me/videos/awesome.webm_ I see that webtorrent copy it as _/tmp/webtorrent/xxx/xxx.webm_. I wanted to know if this was really needed, since the file is already on the disk. \n\nThis could be annoying with big videos (1Go), disk space would rapidly decrease and the seeding would take much time since the disk should copy 1Go before it.\n\nThanks :)\n"
