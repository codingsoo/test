I couldn't find where I could post a question. :)\r\n\r\nIn 1.14 you say:\r\n\r\n> Upgrade platform-tools to 30.0.0 (adb) in Windows releases\r\n\r\nWill I be able to use Scrcpy 1.14 with an older version of ADB? Say version 1.0.36? Unfortunately I have a need to use that version of ADB.\r\n\r\nIf not, should I stay at my current version of Scrcpy which is 1.12 or can I upgrade to 1.13?"

    "initial_question": {
      "title": "Specifying which device to connect to over TCP/IP",
      "body": "Hi, I'm sorry if this isn't the right place for this. I read the instructions and they say that if you have more than one device under `adb devices` you have to specify the serial number of which device you want to connect to. But is there a way to specify which device you want to connect to over TCP/IP when you have multiple devices connected without using the serial number? Like just by specifying the IP address of the device or something like that? \r\n\r\nThe reason I ask is because when devices are connected over USB the serial number is listed when you do `adb devices` (I'm pretty sure that's the serial number... right?) which makes it easy to then input as `scrcpy -s whateveryourserialnumberis` but when devices are connected over TCP/IP it just shows the IP. So you either have to have your serial number written down and saved somewhere or possibly run an adb command to get it (although I can't seem to get any to work). \r\n\r\nIt's not a big deal for someone like me who is only ever really connecting to 2 devices, my phone and my tablet, but I'm interested in if there's a way to do this entirely within the command line rather than having to input the serial number from a saved file or a sticky note or something like that."
