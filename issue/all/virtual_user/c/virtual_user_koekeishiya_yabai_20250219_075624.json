I recently upgraded to Catalina (10.15.4), I have uninstalled chunkwm and installed yabai, however, the tiling does not seem to be working as I would expect. \r\n\r\nUsing the example yabairc and skhdrc, I am able to switch application windows via hotkey (`alt + h`, `alt + l`), so it appears that yabai is working, however, there is no tiling happening. As per the default in the example file, the layout option is set to `yabai -m config layout bsp`. \r\n\r\nAll windows seem to just float, or act as they normally would in macOS. My expectation is that they would tile as they did when I used chunkwm. I have checked both the err and out logs, both are empty. Sip is disabled, I have made the yabairc executable. `Displays have separate Spaces` is enabled in Mission Control and I have disabled `Automatically rearrange Spaces based on most recent use` in Mission Control.\r\n\r\nHave I missed something in the setup? Or have I not properly configured Yabai?"

      "body": "Hi,\r\nI have been experiencing this issue for a long time when using yabai. \r\n\r\nThe thing is: in Chrome, open a new tab by clicking the \"+\" button and then **immediately** click the tab next to it on its left. There is a significant delay to switch to that tab (around 1\\~2 seconds). Also, similarly, after I open a new tab, I immediately click the \"x\" button of the tab next to it instead of the tab itself, this tab will be closed after 1~2 seconds. \r\n\r\nHowever, if I stop the yabai service (by running `brew services stop yabai`), the issue I described above is gone and the smooth is back. \r\n\r\nExcept for Chrome, I have tried other Chromium-based browsers such as Brave, and all of them have the same issue. I also tried Firefox and Safari but both of them performed very well as normal. \r\n\r\nI don't know how to investigate the source of this issue. Please do me a favor. Thank you very much.\r\n\r\nyabai version: the latest\r\nmacOS: 10.15.3 (the latest)"
