I want the assets to be placed in the \"buildings\" and \"equipments\" asset groups.\r\nThe thing is sometimes it works, and sometimes it doesn't. But in the debug of the Rule Chain it tells Success everytime.\r\nI just saw that an asset group \"equipments\" was created at the root level of the tenant, but is empty. So it seems to mean that my asset is placed in this group, then is transfered in the \"all\" group of the customer assets.\r\n\r\nNote : I change the asset owner programmatically in my widget using custom action.\r\nThe code is this.\r\n\r\n```\r\nvm.save = function() {\r\n  vm.addEquipementFormGroup.markAsPristine();\r\n\t\tlet asset = {\r\n\t\t\tname: vm.addEquipementFormGroup.get('equipementName').value,\r\n\t\t\ttype: vm.addEquipementFormGroup.get('assetType').value,\r\n\t\t\tlabel: vm.addEquipementFormGroup.get('equipementName').value\r\n\t\t};\r\n        \r\n               assetService.saveAsset(asset).subscribe(\r\n                 function (asset) {\r\n\t\t\t\twidgetContext.rxjs.forkJoin([\r\n                                 saveAttributes(asset.id),\r\n\t\t\t\tsaveRelations(asset.id)\r\n\t\t\t\t]).subscribe(\r\n                                   function () {\r\n                                                //The owner is the client in which I am located in the dashboard\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvar owner = widgetContext.stateController.stateObject[1].params.entityId;\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tentityGroupService.changeEntityOwner(owner,asset.id).subscribe(\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfunction () {\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twidgetContext.updateAliases();\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tvm.dialogRef.close(null);\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t);\r\n                                 }\r\n\t\t\t    );\r\n              }\r\n           );\r\n  };\r\n```\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nLucas\r\n"

      "body": "**Component**\r\n\r\n<!-- Choose one of the following and delete all others. -->\r\n * UI\r\n * Widget\r\n \r\n**Description**\r\nMy IoT application acquires audio signals from deployed devices. The short audio clips (<500KB) are base64 encoded and sent to TB as a JSON key/value. My goal is to provide access to the latest recordings on the dashboard so the user can quickly evaluate and take necessary action.\r\n\r\nSo I created a new widget to display the html5 audio element and set its src to the base64 encoded data string like this:`src=\"data:audio/wav;base64,UklGRgh3AQBXQVZFZm10IBAAAAAB \u2026 /6//q/+T/3P/g/9v/4//a/+j/3f/o/+X/6P/t//D/9v/3/w==\"`. However, Angular does not permit this because it is considered an unsafe url and disables it by prepending `unsafe` to the string like this: `src=\"unsafe:data:audio/wav;base64,UklGRgh3AQBXQVZFZm10IBAAAAAB \u2026 /6//q/+T/3P/g/9v/4//a/+j/3f/o/+X/6P/t//D/9v/3/w==\"`.\r\n\r\nThe obvious solution is to use Angular's DomSanitizer (`domSanitizer.bypassSecurityTrustUrl()`) but it is not accessible within the widget's scope and it cannot be imported at runtime. A search of this repo shows numerous usages of the DomSanitizer, including in various widget components (ui-ngx/src/app/modules/home/components/widget/lib/alarms-table-widget.component.ts, ui-ngx/src/app/modules/home/components/widget/lib/entities-table-widget.component.ts, ui-ngx/src/app/modules/home/components/widget/lib/timeseries-table-widget.component.ts, etc.). \r\n\r\nIs it possible to access the DomSanitizer in a Widget? If so, how? If not, what other options can I try?\r\n\r\n**Environment**\r\n<!-- Add information about your environment and ThingsBoard version if applicable -->\r\n * OS:  AWS EC2 \r\n * ThingsBoard: PE 3.0.1\r\n * Browser: Chrome 84\r\n"
