So, on my OpenLDAP server, I tried several usually empty LDAP fields where to enter firtsname.lastname for my test user, for example title, employeeNumber, and postOfficeBox. But none of these works as Username LDAP attribute in Keycloak and syncing users fails. The log shows:\r\n\r\nERROR [org.keycloak.storage.ldap.LDAPStorageProviderFactory] (executor-thread-95) Failed during import user from LDAP: org.keycloak.models.ModelException: User returned from LDAP has null username! Check configuration of your LDAP mappings.\r\n\r\n### Version\r\n\r\nlatest\r\n\r\n### Regression\r\n\r\n- [ ] The issue is a regression\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nKeycloak syncs users according to the newly set Username LDAP attribute\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nAn error message is shown which says that no user could be imported\r\n\r\n### How to Reproduce?\r\n\r\nOn the OpenLDAP server, set firstname.lastname as employeeNumber, title and postOfficeBox for some test user. Set one of these as User LDAP attribute in Keycloak and then sync all users.\r\n\r\n### Anything else?\r\n\r\n_No response_"
