      "title": "Export format changes",
      "body": "I have been exporting bulk messages on a weekly basis, and processing them in a google sheet that has been specially set up to handle the data directly copied from a .txt file. Unfortunately, the format of the text in those exports keeps changing, causing errors in my spreadsheet down the line. First, it was a bunch of extra header information at the bottom of the file for some reason, and now messages are exported with two carriage returns between each entry. Since my spreadsheet was setup to delete every third line to ready the data for processing, these rather massive format changes are casing significant problems for me.\r\n\r\nThank you for this awesome app."

Is it therefore just a blanket advantage over the User method, or are there drawbacks to using it?\r\n\r\nIf using the API, Bot's are limited to 100 API requests in a short period. Any more and it's classed as spam and can get your access revoked. Does this use the Discord API or does it merely \"read\" the channel like a User might?"
