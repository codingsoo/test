      "title": "Cannot open game pass game, throws UnauthorizedAccessException",
      "body": "I'm fairly new to all of this, but I do program for a living. I'm playing through a, uh, _foxy_ new game released this week and wished to export the manual pages from within the game to give myself a nice version of them for translation efforts, printing, etc.\r\n\r\nI've installed it via Game Pass/the Xbox app, which means it's thrown in with all the rest of the app store binaries under `C:\\Program Files\\WindowsApps\\`. This directory is typically unreadable by most users, so after working up the guts from reading enough tutorials to make me think it safe, I changed that entire directory's owner to the _Administrators_ group. Since I'm an admin, I can now browse it (in e.g. Windows Explorer) fine, even without _Run as Administrator_.\r\n\r\nHowever, attempting to _Load Folder_ from Asset Studio (I downloaded the `net5` variant) results in the following error:\r\n\r\n```\r\n************** Exception Text **************\r\nSystem.UnauthorizedAccessException: Access to the path 'C:\\Program Files\\WindowsApps\\Finji.TUNIC_1.0.8.0_x64__tys0ffscxatjj\\Secret Legend.exe' is denied.\r\n   at System.IO.FileStream.ValidateFileHandle(SafeFileHandle fileHandle)\r\n   at System.IO.FileStream.CreateFileOpenHandle(FileMode mode, FileShare share, FileOptions options)\r\n   at System.IO.FileStream..ctor(String path, FileMode mode, FileAccess access, FileShare share, Int32 bufferSize, FileOptions options)\r\n   at AssetStudio.AssetsManager.Load(String[] files) in C:\\projects\\assetstudio\\AssetStudio\\AssetsManager.cs:line 51\r\n   at AssetStudio.AssetsManager.LoadFolder(String path) in C:\\projects\\assetstudio\\AssetStudio\\AssetsManager.cs:line 36\r\n   at AssetStudioGUI.AssetStudioGUIForm.<>c__DisplayClass52_0.<loadFolder_Click>b__0() in C:\\projects\\assetstudio\\AssetStudioGUI\\AssetStudioGUIForm.cs:line 163\r\n   at System.Threading.Tasks.Task.InnerInvoke()\r\n   at System.Threading.Tasks.Task.<>c.<.cctor>b__277_0(Object obj)\r\n   at System.Threading.ExecutionContext.RunFromThreadPoolDispatchLoop(Thread threadPoolThread, ExecutionContext executionContext, ContextCallback callback, Object state)\r\n--- End of stack trace from previous location ---\r\n   at System.Threading.ExecutionContext.RunFromThreadPoolDispatchLoop(Thread threadPoolThread, ExecutionContext executionContext, ContextCallback callback, Object state)\r\n   at System.Threading.Tasks.Task.ExecuteWithThreadLocal(Task& currentTaskSlot, Thread threadPoolThread)\r\n--- End of stack trace from previous location ---\r\n   at AssetStudioGUI.AssetStudioGUIForm.loadFolder_Click(Object sender, EventArgs e) in C:\\projects\\assetstudio\\AssetStudioGUI\\AssetStudioGUIForm.cs:line 163\r\n   at System.Threading.Tasks.Task.<>c.<ThrowAsync>b__140_0(Object state)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe program does this whether or not I launch it with _Run As Administrator_. The program seems to be able to open other files in that same directory tree just fine, but the `exe` itself is a problem. Its owner and group don't seem problematic, and I can launch and play the game myself just fine.\r\n\r\nIs this expected, or am I doing something wrong?"
