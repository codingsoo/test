      "title": "Why does whisper.cpp not support Chinese recognition",
      "body": "Whisper supports Chinese recognition. Whisper is an advanced speech recognition system developed by OpenAI, capable of recognizing and transcribing multiple languages, including Chinese. This means Whisper can recognize Chinese speech and convert it into Chinese text. Thanks to its advanced deep learning model, Whisper excels in handling a variety of languages and dialects. Why does whisper.cpp not support Chinese recognition?"
