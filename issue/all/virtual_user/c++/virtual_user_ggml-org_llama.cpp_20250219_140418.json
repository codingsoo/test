      "body": "Hey!\r\n\r\nWhen I attempted to tell the bot in a chat-like prompt that my name is \"Nils\", I ran into an issue where the bot kept interpreting my name as \"Nil\" instead. I then noticed further issues with the word \"guild\" and some other words too.\r\nIs this a bug or to be expected? It does not happen on 30B, I couldn't give 65B a try.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nNiansa"
