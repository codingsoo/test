      "body": "Does exist a way to provide lazy loading of data from perspective-python backend?\r\nWhen I use remote Perspective via perspective-python and Tornado server as in example:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom perspective import Table, PerspectiveManager, PerspectiveTornadoHandler\r\nimport tornado.ioloop\r\nimport tornado.web\r\n\r\n# Create an instance of PerspectiveManager, and host a Table\r\nMANAGER = PerspectiveManager()\r\n\r\nTABLE = Table(large_dataset)\r\nVIEW_2015 = TABLE.view(filter=[[\"Year\", \"==\", \"2015\"]])\r\n\r\nMANAGER.host_view(\"view_2015\", VIEW_2015)\r\n\r\napp = tornado.web.Application([\r\n    # create a websocket endpoint that the client Javascript can access\r\n    (r\"/websocket\", PerspectiveTornadoHandler, {\"manager\": MANAGER, \"check_origin\": True})\r\n])\r\n\r\n# Start the Tornado server\r\napp.listen(8888)\r\nloop = tornado.ioloop.IOLoop.current()\r\nloop.start()\r\n```\r\nand on my frontend load this VIEW:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nperspectiveViewer.load(websocket.open_view(\"view_2015\"))\r\n```\r\nIs there a way to make immediate render of visible rows (or some first chunk of data) and load rest data in background (or by user scroll events)?\r\n\r\nMy dataset that pushing to browser through websocket is ~135Mb, and I need to wait all this data before see any rows."
