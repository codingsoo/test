Can I use this to calculate the distance traveled by measuring the pixels traveled?\r\n\r\n2. Since I am interested in how far away the vehicle is from the intersection, could you give some information about the dimensions( Height, Width and Length) of both vehicles (Mustang and Model 3)? I am assuming that the GPS info of the vehicle is always located at the center of the vehicle according to your documentation.\r\n\r\n3. How to measure the dimension(actual lenght) of both maps? Could you let me know what is size of maps in the unit of pixel so that I can calculate the length on my own? \r\n\r\n4. If I want to make the distance to intersection in town 1 and town 2 the same, should I use the same pixel and node density?
