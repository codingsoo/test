    "initial_question": {
      "title": "Option for button instead of toggle for switches",
      "body": "I have a pi connected to my garage door opener. I am using a command line switch option to open/close my garage door. I am using the same command to both open and close the door, because all it does is turn on a relay for a few seconds and then back off. Would it be possible to have just a push button with one command option. Then maybe in history just show an event and not lable them as on/off?\n"
    },
    "satisfaction_conditions": [
      "Single command execution triggers the door operation regardless of current state",
      "Control must be able to coexist with door state sensor in interface",
      "Control must be groupable with other interface elements"
    ],
