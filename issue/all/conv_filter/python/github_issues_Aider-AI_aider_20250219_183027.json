This will contain the version number and the information about which GPT model aider is using, etc.\r\n\r\nIt looks like the LLM has proposed a filename `**src/screens/HomeScreen.js` that starts with `**`. This makes me think you may be working with GPT-3.5? If so, you would almost certainly have more success with GPT-4 if you have access.\r\n\r\nA simple workaround is to add the file to aider yourself, and then ask GPT to put the code there.

The file was deleted accidentally.\r\n2. The file was never created due to some error during the git operation.\r\n3. The file is there but the path to the file is incorrect.\r\n\r\nHere are a few things you can try to fix this issue:\r\n\r\n1. Try running a `git fsck` command in your repository to check for any corruption or missing files.\r\n\r\n2. If nothing else works, you might need to clone the repository again."
