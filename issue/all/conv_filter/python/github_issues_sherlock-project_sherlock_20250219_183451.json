Here is an example using a Git Bash shell on Windows 10:\r\n```\r\npython -u sherlock.py --site twitter \"name space\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nKeep in mind that there are probably many sites that do not allow spaces in the user name.  Sherlock does not have many of the validity checks configured, so a name that may claim to be available might actually  be illegal."
