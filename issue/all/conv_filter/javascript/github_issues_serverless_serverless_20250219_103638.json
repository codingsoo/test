I replaced it with manually created roles `dev-event-processing-deployment-role` (for deploy) and `dev-event-processing-execution-role` (for execution):\r\n```\r\n  iam:\r\n    # role assumed by account, Jenkins and CloudFormation to deploy resources\r\n    deploymentRole: dev-event-processing-deployment-role\r\n\r\n    # Lambda execution role\r\n    role: dev-event-processing-execution-role\r\n```\r\n\r\nI expected Serverless to just use a new role and do not touch the old one - it should have no knowledge about it. However, upon deploy I get an error:\r\n```\r\nError:\r\nDELETE_FAILED: IamRoleLambdaExecution (AWS::IAM::Role)\r\nAPI: iam:DeleteRolePolicy User: arn:aws:sts::590463175157:assumed-role/dev-event-processing-deployment-role/AWSCloudFormation is not authorized to perform: iam:DeleteRolePolicy on resource: role events-dev-eu-central-1-lambdaRole because no identity-based policy allows the iam:DeleteRolePolicy action\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis can be reproduced with any toy example: create \"hello world\" function with autogenerated IAM role, replace with manually created one without `iam:DeleteRolePolicy`, try to update.\n\n### Service configuration (serverless.yml) content\n\n```yaml\nN/A\n```\n\n\n### Command name and used flags\n\nserverless deploy\n\n### Command output\n\n```shell\nDeploying events to stage dev (eu-central-1)\r\n\r\n\u2716 Stack events-dev failed to deploy (75s)\r\nEnvironment: linux, node 18.6.0, framework 3.22.0 (local), plugin 6.2.2, SDK 4.3.2\r\nCredentials: Local, \"dev\" profile\r\nDocs:        docs.serverless.com\r\nSupport:     forum.serverless.com\r\nBugs:        github.com/serverless/serverless/issues\r\n\r\nError:\r\nDELETE_FAILED: IamRoleLambdaExecution (AWS::IAM::Role)\r\nAPI: iam:DeleteRolePolicy User: arn:aws:sts::590463175157:assumed-role/dev-event-processing-deployment-role/AWSCloudFormation is not authorized to perform: iam:DeleteRolePolicy on resource: role events-dev-eu-central-1-lambdaRole because no identity-based policy allows the iam:DeleteRolePolicy action\n```\n\n\n### Environment information\n\n```shell\nFramework Core: 3.22.0 (local)\r\nPlugin: 6.2.2\r\nSDK: 4.3.2\n```\n",

For instance:\r\n```bash\r\nexport VARIABLE=\"AAA?BBB&CC_C\"\r\necho $VARIABLE\r\n````\r\nWhich is far more common than escaping all the values (for readability):\r\n```bash\r\nexport VARIABLE=AAA?BBB\\&CC\\_C\r\necho $VARIABLE\r\n```\r\nThis PR will only strip \"surrounding\" quotes.\r\n\r\n"
