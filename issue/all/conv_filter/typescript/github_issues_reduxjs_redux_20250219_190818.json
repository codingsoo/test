    "body": "I'm curious about best practices for my use-case (which I believe is probably very common). It's combination of `react`, `redux`, `react-router` but I believe the discussion is best suited for `redux`\n\nDocumentation and guides are very vague when it comes to component-to-component communication (of a non parent-child nature). Imagine using `react-router` where the overall page is derived of nested layout components such as\n\n``` js\nReactDOM.render((\n    <Router>\n        <Route component={DefaultLayout}>\n            <Route path=\"foo\" component={FooLayout}>\n                <Route path=\"products\" component={Products}>\n                <Route path=\"users\" component={Users}>\n                <Route path=\"widgets\" component={Widgets}>\n            </Route>\n        </Route>\n    </Router>\n), document.getElementById('app'))\n```\n\n`DefaultLayout` looks like this:\n\n``` js\nexport default React.createClass({\n    render: function() {\n        return (\n            <div className=\"default-layout\">\n                <div class=\"receive-any-component\"></div>\n                <main>\n                    {this.props.children}\n                </main>\n            </div>\n        )\n    }\n})\n```\n\nFor the sake of this example, `FooLayout` (loaded into `this.props.children`) can be any sub layout you want to imagine. \n\nAll three routes: `/products`, `/users`, or `/widgets` have a button in their component. When clicked, it will load a whole new component into the `DefaultLayout`'s `<div class=\"receive-any-component\"></div>` section. For example\n\n`Products` component:\n\n``` js\nimport store from 'path/to/store'\n\nexport default React.createClass({\n    render: function() {\n        return (\n            <div className=\"product\">\n                Lorem ipsum...\n                <button onClick={this.onClick}>Click Me</button>\n            </div>\n        )\n    },\n    onClick: function() {\n        // There are several ways to have a component loaded DefaultLayout's\n        // div.receive-any-component\n    }\n})\n```\n\nThis whole example is over simplified. I'm using `react-redux` in the real thing. Official react docs only say one small bit on this type of use-case:\n\n> For communication between two components that don't have a parent-child relationship, you can set up your own global event system. Subscribe to events in componentDidMount(), unsubscribe in componentWillUnmount(), and call setState() when you receive an event. Flux pattern is one of the possible ways to arrange this.\n\nSo, I understand that I can use Redux to dispatch info whereby `DefaultLayout` is subscribed, but I need to load a whole component into `DefaultLayout`. It would seem to me there are two basic options, neither of which I feel are correct.\n## Option One\n\nHave our `Product` component dispatch the component we want to load:\n\n``` js\nimport store from 'path/to/store'\nconst componentToLoad = (\n    <Whatever />\n)\n\nexport default React.createClass({\n    render: function() {\n        return (\n            <div className=\"product\">\n                Lorem ipsum...\n                <button onClick={this.onClick}>Click Me</button>\n            </div>\n        )\n    },\n    onClick: function() {\n        store.dispatch({\n            type: 'LOAD',\n            component: componentToLoad\n        })\n    }\n})\n```\n\nUltimately, I'd like the `DefaultLayout` to be unaware of what components it's loading, so this solution works out in that regards. But sending a component into `redux` just seems so wrong, but it works.\n## Option Two\n\nInstead of dispatching a component, dispatch some state that indicates which component should be loaded. In this case, it would seem that `DefaultLayout` would have to `import` every possible component it might need to load (which in my real usecase is many), then subscribe to our state and use a switch statement to determine which one of our loaded components should be placed into `.receive-any-component`. This feels better from the `redux` end but feels crappy that `DefaultLayout` is aware of every possible component that it might need to load.\n\nI'm not new to JS, but somewhat new to React/Redux. What am I missing?\n\nAnd I apologize this question is so long. It's difficult for me to describe this any other way\n",

I don\u2019t think at all it is bad. You can have a separate module that does this.\n\n``` js\nimport Button from './Button'\nimport Checkbox from './Checkbox'\n\nfunction resolveComponent(componentId) {\n  switch (componentId) {\n  case 'BUTTON':\n    return Button\n  case 'CHECKBOX':\n    return Checkbox\n  }\n}\n```\n\nand in your component:\n\n``` js\nfunction mapStateToProps(state) {\n  let Type = resolveComponent(state.componentId)\n  let children = <Type />\n  return { children }\n}\n```\n\nIf your bundler supports code splitting, you can even make `resolveComponent` dynamically load components and return a promise so you can show some default view while component is being loaded.\n"

I wouldn't track that in my redux store, as that's a display concern. I would either have each comment component set up a `setInterval` and re-render as needed.

In that app I'm trying to find the best place for dispatch (e.g. as in `redux-thunk`), and it just happens to make sense to use it from Actions. \n\nHere's a sample action just to illustrate. \n\n```\nimport { RECEIVE_LOCATION } from '../constants/Types';\nimport { defaultPosition } from '../constants/Geo';\nimport store from '../stores';\n\nfunction requestGeolocation() {\n  return function(dispatch) {\n    navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(function(position) {\n      dispatch({\n        type: RECEIVE_LOCATION,\n        coords: {\n          latitude: position.coords.latitude,\n          longitude: position.coords.longitude,\n          inProgress: false,\n        },\n      });\n    });\n  };\n}\n\nexport function getGeolocation() {\n  if (!navigator.geolocation) {\n    return store.dispatch({\n      type: RECEIVE_LOCATION,\n      ...defaultPosition,\n    });\n  }\n  return store.dispatch(requestGeolocation());\n}\n```\n\nObviously `dispatch` didn't come from a view when firing `getGeolocation()`, which is why I'm looking to hear about your take on this approach. This kind of makes sense to me only for the agnostic components where I don't expect bound actions received through props (e.g. `<GeoButton />` that cares less about anything other than triggering that action)\n\nSo my question is, would this pattern break the basic Redux principles?\n",

Whether you care about this or not, is up to you, but we don't encourage this pattern.\n\nWhy not just use thunk middleware to change\n\n``` js\nexport function getGeolocation() {\n  if (!navigator.geolocation) {\n    return store.dispatch({\n      type: RECEIVE_LOCATION,\n      ...defaultPosition,\n    });\n  }\n  return store.dispatch(requestGeolocation());\n}\n```\n\ninto thunk:\n\n``` js\nexport function getGeolocation() {\n  return function (dispatch) {\n    if (!navigator.geolocation) {\n      return dispatch({\n        type: RECEIVE_LOCATION,\n        ...defaultPosition,\n      });\n    }\n    return dispatch(requestGeolocation());\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThen you can dispatch it like this:\n\n``` js\nstore.dispatch(getGeolocation());\n```\n\nand import `store` from your view, if that's what you prefer.\n\nAt this point, though, you should probably put `connect()` without arguments onto your view. Then you'll only get `dispatch` injected as a prop, which is all you need:\n\n``` js\nclass GeoButton extends Component {\n  componentDidMount() {\n    this.props.dispatch(getGeolocation());\n  }\n}\n\nexport default connect()(GeoButton); // just gives it dispatch()\n```\n\nAnother option is to keep your `GeoButton` \u201cdumb\u201d, that is, unaware of Redux.\n\n``` js\nclass GeoButton extends Component {\n  componentDidMount() {\n    this.props.fetch();\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThen you can bind it somewhere else:\n\n``` js\nlet GeoButtonThatKnowsWhatToDo = connect(null, { fetch: getGeolocation })(GeoButton);\n```\n"
