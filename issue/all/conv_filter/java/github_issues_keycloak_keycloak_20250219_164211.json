If one of the users doesn't have this attribute, it will skip the user during import - in the logs you can see the same message you've posted about the username being `null` (admin console says 1 user failed during synch). So whatever attribute is chosen as the username attribute, all entries in LDAP must have it set or Keycloak won't accept importing the user.\r\n\r\nOne thing I've noticed, though, is that while synch works and reports some users failed to be imported (those with `null` values retrieved from LDAP for the username), when searching for all users in the Users screen the whole thing fails if an user from LDAP has a `null` username, instead of skipping them. We might need to revisit the `searchForUserStream` in `LDAPStorageProvider` to keep the behavior consistent."

So here's what is happening:\r\n\r\n1. When we first create an LDAP storage provider, the configured Username LDAP attribute (let's say `uid`), is used to create a `username` mapper that fetches the same attribute from LDAP when loading users, and sets it as the username in Keycloak.\r\n2.  When we edit the Username LDAP attribute in the LDAP provider (let's say to `postOfficeBox`), the change **is not** propagated to the `username` mapper, which is still with the old `uid` value. Without any mappers configured to fetch the `postOfficeBox` attribute from LDAP, the value is read as `null` when importing, giving us the errors you've described.\r\n\r\nIf, after changing the Username LDAP attribute in the main LDAP config you also edit the `username` mapper to the same attribute, synchronizing users work again, and any previously imported user will be updated to the new username.\r\n\r\nIt would be good if the change was propagated to the correct mapper once the LDAP config changes, but for now this is a workaround you can use."
