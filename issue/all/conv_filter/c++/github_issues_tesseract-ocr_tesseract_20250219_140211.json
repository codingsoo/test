    "body": "### Current Behavior\r\n\r\nIn Ubuntu 22.04.6 LTS it supports Tesseract 4.1.1 and my code executing multiple instances of Tesseract on that machine worked. But when I tried it on a newer release (Ubuntu 24.04 with Tesseract 5.3.4) this problem started occurring. To test this I opened to bash terminals and ran the command directly manually one after the other (around the same time) and it does indeed hang. Only after I ctrl+c one of them does the other finish.\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nShould be able to run multiple instances of Tesseract at the same time.

I have waited longer before but i was running more than 2). If you run one of them they finish in like 4 seconds. This is on a \"t2.xlarge\" AWS instance which has \"4 vCPUs\".  The previous one I had did have an AMD with 16 cores so maybe that is why it was fine.\r\n\r\nSo this does not scale very well with multiple instances it seems? Or AWS just has weak CPUs?"

Their build will fall back to the static library, but this can fail by not pulling in Tesseract's dependencies (like `-llept`), or by missing things like `-fsanitize=address`.\r\n\r\n@stweil do you want me to give detailed error messages?",
