        "body": "Hi @Werter12,\r\nThere are several reasons for the output files having a bigger size than the input one's:\r\n- the audio codec/bitrate is not the same: Spleeter outputs wav/PCM 16 bits with 44.1kHz sampling rate by default (so a bit rate of 1440kbps). So if your input is mp3 or aac @320kpbs, then the output files will be 4.5x bigger than the input. you can set the output audio codec with the `-c` option and the output audio bitrate with the `-b` option.\r\n- the input file is mono: then Spleeter will actually start by converting it to stereo, process the file as stereo and output stereo files (so 2x bigger than input)."
