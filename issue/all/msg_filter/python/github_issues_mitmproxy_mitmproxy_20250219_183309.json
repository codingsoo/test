        "body": "Hi Charlie,\n\nthe very short explanation: You specify a directory using `--client-certs`, we search for a *.pem file in there matching the target hostname. For example, suppose you want to open example.com with a client cert, place a PEM file named `example.com.pem` in the certs directoy.\n\nWe should certainly explain that in the docs (PRs welcome :wink:). Thanks for pointing that out.\n\nCheers,\nMax\n"
