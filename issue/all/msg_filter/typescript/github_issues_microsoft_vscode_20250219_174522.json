And I guess that is why nobody complains about this issue. I was not aware of this script as I never allow programs to update PATH.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, I figure out that \"start **/b** <path-to-code.exe>\" also works, which basically sets CREATE_NEW_PROCESS_GROUP and thus the new process won't receive Ctrl-C targeting the original group."

This has the advantage of allowing me to use the mouse less for view adjustment.\n\nI've noticed that there is a difference between how this behaves in the full Visual Studio and in Code. In Visual Studio, when you use Ctrl-Up/Down and the view moves such that the cursor is at the limit of the screen, then the editor will advance the cursor such that it remains on the last line visible. Code, however, does not do this, so the next time you hit a key (e.g. a cursor key without pressing Ctrl) then the view resets back to the line you were originally on which is quite jarring.\n",

That said, this unexpected behavior can be quite frustrating for some of us as it breaks your flow when coding in addition to not matching the feature in other editors.\n\nHowever, I can see how others might like the current behavior so they can scroll a bit to see some code for reference and then snap back to the original context that's possibly offscreen (maybe that's why the original author did it that way?)\n\nPerhaps this is best made into a configuration flag instead of just 'fixing' it as a bug?\n"

This is because the cursor stays put even when it completely scrolls out of view. Since this is all about keyboard navigation, then requiring the mouse seems counter to the spirit of it.\n\nMost editors have the cursor follow along at the top or bottom of the screen (depending on scroll direction) when scrolling beyond the current view. In that way, there's no jarring snap back to another location off-screen when you start moving the cursor with arrow keys again or start typing.\n\nHowever, some editors additionally allow you to hit ESC to snap back to the original position in the cases where you're scrolling just to take a peek instead of wanting to stay in the new location.\n"
