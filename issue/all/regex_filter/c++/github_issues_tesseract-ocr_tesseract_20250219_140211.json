The error suggests that Tesseract can't initialize with the custom model:\r\n\r\n\r\n```TesseractError: (1, \"Error: LSTM requested, but not present!! Loading tesseract.

It works brilliantly well. Lately, I noticed its predictability changes when the same code is run multiple times for the same image text. I was able to train new fonts in different languages. An example is this: when I run to get the font properties of an image, I'm getting these properties: font-name, bold, italic, monospace, serif, and underline. I ran it multiple times on the same image text, and it produces different results for the same image text.\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior:\r\nThe text on the image should return this result: \r\nUbuntu, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, PASS, but subsequent runs produce different results for the same text on the same image.

        "body": "I think this is a (minor) bug.\r\n\r\nWhen Tesseract fails to create a file (missing rights, disk full, or any other reason on any operating system), this should always be handled somehow in the code. In most cases at least a warning should be printed, other cases are fatal errors. We also have conditions where Tesseract creates a file, but terminates before writing to that file. I'd consider such empty files also as a bug.\r\n\r\nSo for this issue the code needs a fix. If a user sets `-c tessedit_write_images=1`, there should be either a valid output file or a warning message. I'll have a look and prepare a pull request."
