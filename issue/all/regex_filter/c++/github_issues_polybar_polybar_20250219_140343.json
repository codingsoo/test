Right now this is already happening for bigger features and stuff, but I think we should do this for all changes. Like this we would have a dedicated space for each change, it's easier for everyone to keep track or what's happening and why and this also allows us to group a set of changes together. This can also be used to make sure that no commit fails a travis build.\r\n\r\nFor coding guidelines it would probably be good to add a pre commit hook that automatically formats the code to conform to certain style guidelines.\r\nI don't think having many coding rules is wise because it would add a lot of overhead for first-time contributors and it probably wouldn't help the readability of the code that much.\r\n\r\nCan `--ff-only` be forced in a github PR or would we have to merge PRs on the command line?"
