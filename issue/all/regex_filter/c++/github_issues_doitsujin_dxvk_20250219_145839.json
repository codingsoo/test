This alone would already break a million games without targeted workarounds as well as extremely good understanding of every little detail on window messages and relelvant GDI APIs (which we don't have) since games can reasonably assume that their 640x480 window is actually 640x480 and not 2880x2160 or something, but even if that worked, we'd also have to remap all mouse input etc as well.\r\n\r\nOn Linux, Gamescope is the way to go to run games at weird resolutions.\r\n\r\n> which makes the game show the HUD big like the small resolution, but the rest of the rendering is big resolution.\r\n\r\nThis is also not possible to do at all in a generic way, we cannot know when a game does \"normal\" rendering as opposed to drawing its UI or doing internal computations that *must* happen at a specific resolution to be correct, it all looks the same to us. You're looking at manually patching shaders etc for thousands of games if you don't want to limit this kind of functionality to the most basic of D3D8 / early D3D9 games."

It might seem like a long time because there never was another stable release after 1.0, but bleeding edge code wise d8vk kept the two file separately through most of its life.\r\nThe reason for going back to dynamically linking again was that there were some games on Windows, when doing testing there, that didn't work properly with the statically linked d3d9 (I don't know the reason at hand).

Time, energy, resources, etc. are a given, but I was thinking about those factors in relation to e.g. \"how different are the D3D versions to each other (e.g. version 8 vs. 7 or 6)?\", \"how much effort does it take to push downwards, i.e. adding support for v. 7, v. 6...\" and \"is there even a point in supporting earlier versions than 8?\"  \r\n\r\nI got curious after running a D3D 6 game in Wine and hearing the fans on full blast, realizing I'm not using DXVK and that I don't know the details of why that is. \r\n\r\nThis is not a feature request, I'm just interested in hearing about the complexities at work in this kind of project. \r\n",

And since we're dealing with relatively crude APIs, untangling everything isn't exactly straight-forward. In that respect, it would be a far more challenging proposition (IMHO) than d8vk was. \r\n\r\nAnd, as @K0bin mentioned, because of the technical debt it would entail, there's basically very little (if any) interest to support any of the older D3D APIs in dxvk.\r\n\r\nIf you *really* want to get them onto dxvk for some reason, feel free to use wrappers that translate between said APIs and D3D9 or D3D11. It's what I had been doing for years in the case of D3D8 by using d3d8to9 with dxvk/d9vk, long long before d8vk came along."

If you want @SteveEbey73742 i can make up a quick one for all the symlink creation you want?\r\n\r\nI don't know about WoW, but it works well with the offline games I play."

    "body": "Hello, fellow developers. \r\n\r\nI am wondering, how hard using DXVK as a wrapper for Linux ports to minimize work?\r\n\r\nAll that I understood on this moment: DXVK provides DXGI(which initializes the D3D10/11 driver) and D3D10/11 implementation DLLs. For build it requires Wine headers. \r\nSo, for example, I am porting some game engine with D3D10 and D3D11 renderer backends. Game engine successfully initializes Vulkan with SDL2. Windows build already works fine with DXVK on Wine. Then... \r\n1) Do I need DXVK's DXGI to be compiled-in to engine? Can I use just DXVK's D3D10/11 wrapper? \r\n2) Can I just use Wine's definitions, not the code(winelib) itself?\r\n\r\nDon't know if it was posted before, if so, sorry for taking your time.",

        "body": "It's an interesting use case, but I don't think it's feasible to use DXVK for porting right out of the box **unless** your entire port is based on winelib. DXGI is tightly coupled to the win32 window management API, which causes a number of issues: \r\n\r\n- Implementations of `IDXGISwapChain` and `IDXGIOutput` would have to be rewritten against whatever you use for window management (in this case, SDL2). It currently uses raw win32 functions.\r\n- Linux window system support would need to be added to the backend so that DXVK can create a `VkSurface` for your window.\r\n- Some other win32-specific stuff would need to be rewritten or removed, but those should be simple.\r\n\r\nI haven't explored the option of using DXVK for native apps yet, so there might be more potential issues."
