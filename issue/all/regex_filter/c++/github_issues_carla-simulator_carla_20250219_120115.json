While we’ve added a few unmodified vehicles to maintain diversity, we also removed some older or low-poly vehicles from the Vehicle Factory.\r\n\r\nTo add a vehicle to the factory, the process has changed. You now need to recreate the entire Blueprint for the vehicle, as the existing one is not compatible due to the switch from Chaos to PhysX. Once the new Blueprint is created, you can add it to the Vehicle Factory.\r\n\r\nTo do so, you’ll need to use the VehicleParameters.json file, where all the necessary parameters for the vehicle should be defined.\r\n\r\nLet me know if you need further clarification!"

The logged velocity data , along the y axis and the y axis coordinate seems like the logged data is mirrored . I am aware that CARLA UE follows Left handed coordinate system with x forward y to the right and z up . So is the logged information in Right Handed coordinate system with y mirrored and also the yaw and pitch \r\n\r\nAny inputs on this will be helpful. Thanks in advance.\r\n",

You may want to upgrade and try using this (I have not yet).\r\nBefore CARLA 0.9.11, I don't think it is possible to get the exact steering angle, though a workaround I used is:\r\n```\r\nphysics_control = vehicle.get_physics_control()\r\nwheels = physics_control.wheels\r\nmax_steering_angle = wheels[0].max_steer_angle\r\nangle = vehicle.get_control().steer*max_steering_angle\r\n```\r\nIf a `carla.VehicleControl` was previously applied to a vehicle (should also work if not), then these lines of code gives `angle`, which is the angle the controller intends to set the steering angle to. Since the wheels take some time to turn from one angle to another angle, this is not the latest or the current steering angle. I think it's an OK approximation *if* your steering rate is small e.g. <40 degrees but you may want to test."

Refer to the example scripts supplied with CARLA (such as tutorial.py) to see how the sensors output data. The sensors have a \"listen\" function which takes a callback to save the data on each simulation step. The image sequence is then saved to a folder on your hard drive. You can then convert this image sequence to video using another tool such as QuickTime.\r\n\r\nThanks for your question"

An alternative is to use RoadRunner's Curve Marking Tool and draw stop lines manually (note these will not be tied to XODR, traffic logic, etc. but will look cosmetically. This is time intensive and ideally Carla could parse xodr correctly. \r\n\r\n@Axel1092 thoughts? ",

        "body": "Hello @SanggunLee,\r\nRight now it is not possible to get the id of the actor through a camera. Anyway, I can see a couple of ways in which you could do that.\r\n - You could modify (or create another) semantic segmentation camera to output the id in the form of colors instead of the tag information. This could be a bit tricky because you need to modify the server and also to codify correctly the ids as colors so you can recover the information but I'm principle it is possible.\r\n - The other possibility can be done directly in the client but require some processing. You can use the semantic lidar to identify the ids and then project the points into the RGB image and identify the ids coming from the semantic lidar to the pixels in the image. The projection of the point is done for the normal lidar in the example script 'lidar_to_camera.py' so you have something to start there."

        "body": "Hello @qqqGpe,\r\nThere is a couple of things that I don't see correct in your computations. As I imagine that you are in asynchronous mode, be very careful about what you compare. The client is going to receive the callback of the radar at some point after is being computed so don't use `time.time()` to compute the time. That has nothing to do with the simulation time and it is being saved when the callback is executed in the client. Use `radar_data.timestamp` to get the simulation timestamp at which the data were computed. Second, be careful also with computing the velocity of the points subtracting with the previous points. You cannot be sure that the N detection of two frames will correspond to the same location in the world. \r\n\r\nAnyway, these two things have nothing to do with the detection velocities. I have run a test with a car driving at a constant velocity of 60 km/h (around 16.6 m/s) and then checked the detections. As the car is the only dynamic object all detections should be more or less below that value. I also removed the `bp.set_attribute('sensor_tick', str(0.33))` option for the test.\r\n\r\nThis is what I get:\r\n```\r\ndelta t is:0.151 s, Car: 15.020 Detection0: -10.441 Aver: -10.365 Max: -10.575 Min: -9.769\r\ndelta t is:0.134 s, Car: 15.787 Detection0: -11.873 Aver: -11.671 Max: -11.904 Min: -11.005\r\ndelta t is:0.072 s, Car: 15.660 Detection0: -16.196 Aver: -15.879 Max: -16.196 Min: -14.967\r\ndelta t is:0.060 s, Car: 15.931 Detection0: -16.307 Aver: -15.984 Max: -16.309 Min: -15.076\r\ndelta t is:0.067 s, Car: 16.006 Detection0: -16.219 Aver: -15.917 Max: -16.239 Min: -15.017\r\ndelta t is:0.063 s, Car: 14.996 Detection0: -15.541 Aver: -15.969 Max: -16.281 Min: -15.041\r\ndelta t is:0.126 s, Car: 15.024 Detection0: -12.513 Aver: -12.339 Max: -12.584 Min: -11.633\r\n```\r\nI am comparing the speed of the car, the radial velocity of detection 0, and then the average, the maximum, and the minimum velocity.\r\nNotice that the velocity of the car does not necessarily correspond with the frame at which the radar data was computed but as it is supposed to be more or less constant is should be fine.\r\n\r\nThe problem appears if the `sensor_tick` is too high. For the value of `0.33` I also have observed values that make no sense. It seems that we have a problem with our computation of the velocity in this case. I hope you can use a lower value (or remove the attribute to get the data for all ticks) and we will try to fix it as soon as we can. \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Each sensor performs differently and its performance can be evaluated correctly if I know the type of physical materials in the environment. Lidar and radar sensor models  checks the returned signal characteristics based on object surface. My question is that: where I can get an information about the object materials in carla? I am testing now lidar sensor model from another manufacturer in the market and they have a list of materials (tree, steel, glass, plastic, concrete) with exact parameters ( roughness values, coefficients and constants) in the simulation. I want to evaluate the carla sensor model performance by comparing it with that another sensor model. In order to compare two different sensor models, I need to adjust same scenario with same materials. I am testing a lidar sensor model in Town04 in both simulation frameworks (another simulator is also built in UE4 game engine and support Town04 environment scenario). In order to compare the performance of both simulaor lidar sensor models, the only thing I should provide is the same materials parameters. \r\n\r\nCan someone help me on this issue?",

If in the stable version of Carla 0.8.2, I set the scene to multi-lane. How should I add a vehicle (the vehicle included in the version) to a place in the multi-lane? At the same time, how to modify the attributes of these vehicles (for example: speed)? Do I need to compile after modification?

The `new_map_name` needs to be one of the existing maps such as `Town01`, `Town02`, etc. Notice that we also offer `Town01_opt` versions of the maps which offer a small performance improvement."

For our PID do not use the target velocity itself, rather we use the **error** from our current velocity and the target velocity we want to reach. Then, it's divided by the target velocity to make the error a bit smaller, which helps reducing the oscillations when the PID is close to 0.\r\n\r\nIt will work with current_velocity - target_velocity as well, we just chose that particular formula because we had some issues tuning our PID and this solution helped us. Ultimately, the goal of the PID is to get as close to 0 as possible, and we want to help as we can!\r\n\r\nLet me know if this solves your doubt"

I've been using CARLA 0.9.10 for a while now, and I am still not able to understand (intuitively) what a vector is in CARLA.\r\n\r\nFor eg., consider the ```GetForwardVector()``` function. After going through it's source code, I understood that the point is transformed by rotating it and translating it by the respective Euler angles and transformation matrices. The function then returns the transformed point. However, a vector would theoretically require two points for it's definition right? (one to define it's initial position, and the other to define the end point). So my question is, How is this vector defined in this case, as the function returns only the transformed point? Is it assumed that the initial point is the center of mass of the vehicle?\r\n\r\nAny insights/ hints would immensely help me.  Thank you so much.\r\n",

Of course, as you mentioned, the forward, up, and right vectors are calculated based on the transform's rotation using coordinate transformation matrices, and this is also what I mentioned in my question.\r\n\r\nThe doubt arrives here. For a vector to be defined \"mathematically\" you need two points. The direction of a vector then is from the initial point (usually chosen as the origin, but need not be) to the final point. In CARLA, the final point alone is the one that is getting transformed via rotation. My question is where is the initial point for that forward, up, and right vector? Is it assumed that the initial point is on the car's center of mass?\r\n\r\nThanks"

If you don't set the fixed_delta_seconds, the time delta is related with the fps. In order to assure a correct simulation just set fixed_delta_seconds so your time delta is not dependent on your fps."

Specifically, my agent looks like:  \r\n```python3\r\nimport torch.multiprocessing as mp # I use pytorch 1.4 with python 3.7.9\r\n\r\nclass SomeAgent(mp.Process):\r\n    ....\r\n\r\n    def run(self):\r\n        ...\r\n        some_carla_env._world.try_spawn_actor(vehicle_blueprint, transform)\r\n        ...\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen I tried to create multiple agent by:\r\n```python3\r\nworkers = [SomeAgent(...) for i in range(10)]\r\n[w.start() for w in workers] # using fork here\r\n[w.join() for w in workers]\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen I debug this problem, there is really not to much traceback I have. What I am only sure is that it never returns from try_spawn_actor thus hanging there forwever. Looking forward to any solution to this problem. Thanks.",

I tried to import an opendrive file but I have the following problem:\r\n\r\n\r\n-Every time I import a traffic light and run the simulation It fails. If I import a building o tree or stop signals, the simulation doesn't fail.\r\n\r\n-I have another problem that perhaps is not related to the editor part of the software. When I run the simulation in autopilot mode (set_autopilot(True)) in a road network defined in an opendrive file,  the car at some points of the route starts swinging more and more until to rotate on itself. I think it's due to the code of autopilot, but I'm not sure about it. I wonder why in other roads defined in other opendrive files already present in the software (like BigTown), the car never goes unstable.\r\n\r\n-I would like to know if it possible to modify the path the vehicle should follow. I generate the route from an opendrive file in Unreal Engine. I see the route and the vehicle seems to follows the trajectory, (apart from when it goes into instability). I want to edit this route and make the vehicle follow a path perfectly. For example I would like to create a zig-zag path and I would like the vehicle to run it without mistakes.\r\n\r\n -I found out that there is “City Map Generator” as a component in Unreal Engine, but I don’t know I can use it to generate roads. I use “Open drive actor” to generate routes and then create the roads based on the routes that I can see , but as you can imagine the result is not perfect.\r\nI would like to know how to use City Map Generator to generate the roads that I can see on openstreet.\r\n\r\nPlease someone can help me to solve all these problems? I would really appreciate it!\r\n",

        "body": "Hi @goksanisil23 \r\n\r\nFrom the perspective of making an unstructured map, you would have to leverage UE4's editor or external tools (perhaps a combination of both). Then you would need to give up all the NPC controllers (Traffic Manager, etc.), and put together your own navigation logic.\r\n\r\nYou may think that something like the LocalPlanner could be reused since it only depends on some general waypoints that the user could provide as input. However, I believe this may not be the case. The LocalPlanner has been designed and tested in road environments, so other --harsh-- environments may put the LocalPlanner in serious trouble. \r\n\r\nAgain, my recommendation is to create your own control logic for those environments leveraging the control API (steering, throttle, etc.). At a minimum you would need:\r\n\r\n- A global planner. In your case, this may be A* or something trivial (start and end waypoints?)\r\n- A local planner. The \"meat\" of the problem... In unstructured environments, you may need a lot of feedback from the environment to adjust your local planner. \r\n- A controller. You would need to heavily tune the default PID controllers or even introduce a more sophisticated control strategy.\r\n\r\nThis is not on our agenda yet, but we welcome contributions and collaborations. If there is enough interest we could collaborate."

However, the pedestrians with walker AI controllers still seem to behave in non-deterministic ways. This would prohibit users from repeating the simulation over multiple runs. \r\n\r\nIt would be great if you can let me know if there is already a workaround for making walkers with AI controller **deterministic*. Can you let me know if there is a seed within the AI controller that can help me replicate the same simulation over multiple runs?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.\r\n \r\n",

You can add or remove these objects at any point of the simulation altering this way the order and therefore the index will possibly change. But if you don't create or delete any objects of this type the index will keep the same.\r\n\r\nMoreover, this index is only valid for the same simulation, it's not guaranteed to be the same between simulations. If you need to identify no spawnable objects like traffic lights you could use `world.get_environment_objects(carla.CityObjectLabel.TrafficLight)` which returns a list of `carla.EnvironmentObject`s. Each `EnvironmentObject` has a unique id that is valid between simulations and also had the bounding box of the object.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Notice that both are given in the local coordinate system of the sensor, not in the global one.\r\nBe careful with this coordinate system because most of the visualization software uses the inverse convention for the Y-axis so you will see everything mirror in this axis. If you check our script that visualizes the lidar with Open3D, we are flipping this coordinate for consistency with the Carla frame.\r\nFor the IMU, the accelerometer uses this coordinate frame, if you check the manual_control script, you will see that the vehicle forwardly accelerating results in x-acceleration measurement. Respect to the gyroscope, the same is true, measuring the rotation respect to X, Y, and Z defined as I commented above.\r\n"

After little bit of reverse engineering I managed to figure out how to register classes that were already included in UE4 such as Directional lights or Atmospheric Fog. I did this using the \"ActorView.h\" and \"ActorRegistry.cpp\" scripts.\r\n\r\nHowever, when I try to add my own blueprint classes, I just get an error that says \"Use of undeclared Identifier\" when I try to start the engine. I saw that you had added a \"TrafficSignBase\" blueprint that derives from AActor and that works fine, however when I try to add my \"CustomBlueprintBase\" that also derives from AActor I get the error mentioned above.\r\n\r\nThe error mentioned occurs in the \"ActorRegistry.cpp\" script first in the part where you cast to the actor type itself. As mentioned this works perfectly when adding things that are included in UE4, but not with my own items.\r\n\r\nDo you have any tips that could help me include our own blueprint classes for later use in python? Am I going about the right way to register my own blueprint classes or am I missing a step?\r\n\r\nThanks",

    "body": "Hi!\r\nI'm planning to add a new car into Carla with more realistic vehicle lateral dynamical model, namely a \"bicycle model\" with Pacejka tire model. Though Carla has provided some tuning parameters on vehicle dynamics like tire friction, wheel damping rate, etc, the actual vehiclular model seems to be based on the Unreal engine vehicle blueprint, whose model is tied to the PhsicX engine. Is there any way to quickly swap that vehicle model? Do I have to make a custom blueprint class in the Unreal engine from scratch, or is there any quick way to do so? Thank you very much!",

In principle you can do it directly in BP in Unreal but with this you would loose most of the functionality that we provide for vehicles. In you look into the class hierarchy of vehicles, you would see that Carla's vehicles all inherit from ACarlaWheeledVehicle that inherit from AWheeledVehicle (from VehiclePhysX). Maybe you could create a Bicycle class that inherits from ACarlaWheeledVehicle and override the behaviour you want to replace. And then based your BP in that class.\r\nBe aware that most of the Vehicle behaviour is controlled on ACarlaWheeledVehicle::ApplyVehiclePhysicsControl, if you replace this function to control your car instead of using UWheeledVehicleMovementComponent, I think it should be ok.\r\n "

Instead of printing them, you can append the data to a `list` or a `numpy array`.

The first thing I want to do is to measure the delay between the frame creation (by UnrealEngine), and the moment when the frame is drawn (pygame.display.flip()). As the frames have a timestamp attribute, I assumed that this would be straightforward, but I see that this timestamp is relative to the creation of the Episode and not an absolute system clock value. Is there a way to know precisely when the Episode was created ? Or to measure the serialization time, RPC time, deserialization time, and finally the numpy conversion time. (By the way, in order to bypass the frame transmission, I also tried to \"play in the world view\" by changing the spectator's position at every frame using the hero's camera transform, but the result is very bad - is there a way to do that (rendering in the server only) ?)

You'd need some serious geometry to get the line that intersects the bounding box, and some calculus to get the percentage off-road. There might a library that does this very efficiently but I can't think of one. \r\n\r\nAn approximation would be to get the eight points of the bounding box (vertices and middle points) and get how many of the 8 are offroad. To know if you are off_road you can either:\r\n1) get_waypoint(self, location, project_to_road=False), which will return None if the location is outside driving lane\r\n2) get_waypoint(self, location, project_to_road=False, lane_type=carla.LaneType.Any), which will return a waypoint, and if its lane_type is different than *Driving*, the location is out."

In my experience it requires a lot of hard-coding in road ids and other OpenDRIVE metadata to be able to create these paths that non-ego vehicles can follow in the simulator. It would be really great if there was a way to even just drive a vehicle using manual_control, and have the recorder record all the OpenDRIVE waypoints the vehicle touches during the drive cycle, so that on these beautiful maps there is a way to create a specified, repeatable path quickly.\r\n\r\nAnother feature that I would like to request is being able to run CARLA in a sort of \"annotation mode\" where all OpenDRIVE metadata for the map is displayed so that even if the hard-coding is still necessary, we aren't fighting the lane explorer's random walks trying to get information for the roads we want.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n",

We have fixed the issue and it is currently under review in a PR so it should be in master very soon and also, with a several other improvements for the LiDAR sensor, it will be available in the next release.\r\nAlso, it is true what you comment about the pygame coordinate system. There is a sign difference in the y axis due to the frame that Unreal uses so printing it will be mirrored. If you want to visualize the same as in the editor you can just mirror the y-axis in your python script."

When I get vehicle location, it is usually (x=10, y=20, z=0.5) for example and wheel positions are values Vector3D(x=-10369.056641, y=-3405.956055, z=36.998440). \r\n\r\nHow can I get position of the wheel in same coordinate system as a vehicle location. The idea is to calculate distance from the Front Right Wheel to closest right lane waypoint. I can get waypoint of the vehicle of the center, but still not sure how to access the closest lane waypoint to the right. Here is code I use:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n...\r\nvehicle = world.spawn_actor(vehicle_bp, vehicle_transform)\r\n\r\nphysics = vehicle.get_physics_control()\r\nwheels = physics.wheels\r\nwheel_FL = wheels[0]\r\nwheel_FR = wheels[1]\r\nwheels_RL = wheels[2]\r\nwheels_RR = wheels[3]\r\n\r\nwheel_location = wheel_FR.position  # Vector3D(x=-10369.056641, y=-3405.956055, z=36.998440)\r\n\r\nvehicle.get_transform().location  # Vector3D(x=10, y=20 z=0.5)\r\nwaypoints = world.get_map().get_waypoint(vehicle_location, project_to_road=True, lane_type=carla.LaneType.Driving)\r\nworld.debug.draw_string(waypoints.transform.location, 'O', draw_shadow=False,\r\n                        color=carla.Color(r=0, g=255, b=0), life_time=20,\r\n                        persistent_lines=True)\r\n```"

I want to know more informations about CarlaServer's libs and dlls. Why do you create dll and lib files in intermedidate layer? You have some codes in Plugin folder and some codes in Util folder? You have two same header carlaserver.h and two same CarlaEncoder.cpp and CarlaEncoder.h in both of folders. Could you describe about them?  \r\nThanks alot,",

If this is true for your model you could either delete your simple collision and generate one manually yourself (Most efficient) or, in the details panel of the mesh, under collision, change collision complexity to \"Use Complex Collision as Simple\" this way it will use all the geometry of the model as collision (This option is a bit more costly but will probably work right away).

I've got the code building and running from within the Unreal Engine, but I'm seeing some odd behavior. When I run from within the unreal editor without the server (i.e. UseNetworking=false in CarlaSettings.ini), everything runs fine (fps > 60). When I run from within the editor with the server enabled (i.e. UseNetworking=true in CarlaSettings.ini), the simulator runs really slowly (<3 FPS). Also, I cannot get any sensor data - whenever I call client.read_data() (e.g. in client_example.py), I get an AssertionError (len(raw_data) < 4 * width * height). \r\n\r\nIs this expected? Ultimately, I'm just interested in exposing additional data streams in the python client, so I'd also be happy if there's another way to test that as well.",

Keep in mind that if you generate a road with the spline repeater the lane information will be missing, meaning the vehicle will appear always as driving off-road and the autopilot won't work. However, if you still want to use it you can easily script it with Unreal blueprints.\r\n\r\nWe will soon start working on a better map generator with curvy roads and a varying number of lanes, but it will take time as it is a fairly complex addition."

        "body": "@felipecode am I correct in understanding that the code to generate semantic segmentation images is written by the Carla team. If so, is there some way for a simple tweak in that algorithm to create instance segmentation?\r\n\r\nI basically want to test a Faster-RCNN for object detection in Carla. Now to get the ground truth bounding boxes I can have 2 approaches:\r\n\r\n1. Somehow using the given camera data and the 3D position, orientation and size of the object, I project the bounding box onto my camera view. But this requires some knowledge of perspective mapping and other CV topics. Still, it wont really work well since the Z axis length of the bounding box is not correct in the given data.\r\n\r\n2. Use the Semantic Segmentation to create a bounding box for each type of class in the scene. This is really easy to implement where your topX=minX , topY = minY, W=(maxX - minX) and H=(maxY - minY) but you should have only one instance of the class in the scene for this kind of bounding box creation to be done. This would work easily if we were provided with instance segmented images instead.\r\n\r\nIn the second scenario,even with the SemSeg images if objects were far away, it would be possible to create the ground truth bounding boxes by just checking if the two blobs were connected (Again, we would require knowledge of CV for that). But it would completely fail if the Objects were intersecting in the SemSeg.\r\n\r\nAnyway, If you could suggest me on a way I could create the bounding box of the objects in camera FOV, it would really be helpful.\r\n\r\n@nsubiron in #242 I think I didn't frame my question well but what I wanted was not just filtering out of the objects in the scene but to get their information with respect to the scene. Example the tpX, tpY, W, H of bounding box of objects in scene in pixels. "
