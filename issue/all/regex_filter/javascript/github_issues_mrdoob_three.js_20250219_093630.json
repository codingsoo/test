Now I'm facing the issue that a transformation applied to an object is applied twice to its child.\n\nExample:\n\n``` javascript\nvar planegeo = new THREE.PlaneGeometry(50, 50);\nvar planemat = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial( {color: 0xffff00, opacity: 0.25, transparent: true, side: THREE.DoubleSide});\nplane = new THREE.Mesh(planegeo, planemat);\n\nvar pedges = new THREE.EdgesHelper(plane, '#dd8888');\nplane.add(pedges);\n\nplane.translateZ(20);\nplane.rotateOnAxis(new THREE.Vector3(0,1,0), 0.7 * Math.PI);\n```\n\nHere, pedges translates by 40 units and does twice the rotation. So it's displaced from the plane which schouldn't be. It worked well with `r67`.\n\nDid you change something or is this a bug?\n",

Suggestions?\n",

        "body": "So I've tried to implement what I described in this thread using just the add/remove events as you suggested, and I've hit several stumbling blocks. The intention of the code below is to maintain a list of all the `<arbitrary THREE.Object3D subclass>` which are contained in a given scene:\n\n``` javascript\n\n  // in the  <arbitrary THREE.Object3D subclass> constructor\n\n  // if added to scene\n    this.addEventListener( 'added', function ( event ) {\n\n        var scene = this;\n        while ( scene.parent !== undefined ) {\n            scene = scene.parent;\n        }\n\n        if ( scene !== undefined && scene instanceof THREE.Scene )  {\n            scene.__mySpecialObjects = scene.__mySpecialObjects || []\n            if (scene.__mySpecialObjects.indexOf(this) === -1) scene.__mySpecialObjects.push(this)\n            this.__scene = scene\n        }  \n\n    });\n\n    // if removed from scene\n    this.addEventListener( 'removed', function ( event ) {\n\n        if (this.__scene) {\n            var i = this.__scene.__mySpecialObjects.indexOf(this)\n            if ( i !== -1 ) this.__scene.__mySpecialObjects.splice(i, 1)\n            this.__scene = null\n        }\n\n    });\n```\n\nHere are some of the issues: \n- I had to repeat some of the logic in Object3D in order to determine which (if any) scene the object was actually added to. This works but it breaks the DRY principle. \n- No way of knowing which scene the object was removed from unless I saved a reference to that scene in association with the object (in this case I stored a reference to the scene directly on the object in a `__scene` property). This also works but it feels sloppy :)\n- Biggest Issue: I am unable to maintain a list when the object is indirectly added to the scene, as following: \n\n``` javascript\nvar o = new THREE.Object3D()\nvar x = new MySpecialObject3D()\no.add(x) // <--- not part of scene yet\nmyScene.add(o)  // <-- x is indirectly added to scene, but 'added' event is not dispatched on x\n```\n- Also, this approach will only work for classes that I define myself. I can't, for example, easily maintain a list for a built-in three.js type (without traversing the whole scenegraph, or relying on `scene.__objectsAdded` or `scene.__objectsRemoved`).\n\nMy proposed solution is to dispatch `addedToScene` and `removedFromScene` events (or similar events) from `THREE.Scene.prototype.__addObject` and `THREE.Scene.prototype.__removeObject`, respectively. I believe this would be all that is needed for me to accomplish what I'm trying to do (and it would allow me to keep track of types that I haven't declared myself). In some ways, this isn't very different than relying on the `scene.__objectsAdded` and `scene.__objectsRemoved` arrays directly, but it seems that using events would be more flexible / future-proof. \n\nWhat do you think @mrdoob ? \n"

    "body": "Hi guys\n\nI have written an octree in threejs and i've been testing it in a pretty big scene. It works nicely enough but there doesn't seem to be any marked difference. \n\nFrom my research I can see that three uses a flat list when doing its rendering. I can see that for each item it checks its visibility and then does the frustum calculations. \n\nIn the octree I developed I am setting the objects visibility property to false if its out of the frustum and so if the camera is looking at a corner of the scene outwards, the other half / two-thirds are not visible. My thoughts were that this would cut out a lot of the render calculations etc...\n\nThis doesn't actually seem to improve the speed though... The time to render stays pretty much the same whether the octree is on or off (Even though I can see its set half the scene to not visible ). \n\nI was wondering if this is because the render list is flat. Perhaps by adding some functionality to allow us to take out big chunks of the rendering pipeline it might speed up the scene somewhat? \n\nJust wanted to know hear your thoughts on it.\n\nThanks guys\nMat\n",

It is just a bunch of simple draw calls unless you are doing simulation or something.\n\nI think that if you have a very large outdoor scene, it makes sense to cull a lot but if you are just reducing 50% of your draw calls and you don't have a ton to begin with, it isn't much of a benefit.\n\nGame engines show different levels of details based on how close they are to the camera.  They also use distance culling a lot in outdoor scenes, especially to control what you are loading.  Reducing the amount of data loaded makes a big difference because a level may not actually fit into GPU memory.\n\nI think if you can cut draw calls by 90% of really detailed scenes, octree-based culling will seem more useful.\n\nBut generally people don't use octrees for culling small scenes, there just isn't enough benefit.\n"

I've gone about it by making a large number of terrain tiles and placing them next to each other as separate meshes. I did try to brute force render it as one large mesh but it did struggle quite a bit; so instead I chopped it up into many smaller tiles. I figured creating an octree would then help to reduce the calls to which objects need to be drawn. I just tested it again, but this time with a really really large scene, and I do see an improvement in using the Octree - but its still not ideal. It definitely feels a bit laggy. \n\nI think what I'll do is expose the ''renderList' variable in the render process and see if handing over only the visible objects helps it a bit. \n\nThanks\n"

    "body": "Hello everyone!\n\nSo, basically I need to get the full geometry of a object up to the shader. From what I've read, my only option is to use textures.\nBased on the examples by @alteredq, I pass a texture as a uniform containing the vertexes, using for example on a plane:\n\n``` javascript\n\"plane_data\" : { type: \"t\", value: 1,texture: build_data_texture(plano_geo.vertices,plano_geo.vertices.length)}\n```\n\nAnd here's the build_data_texture that I use, based on the examples I found:\n\n``` javascript\n// Normalize all the vertex values to between 0...255, which are put in the \"normalized\" array\n//<snip>\n//Making sure that the textureWidth will be power of 2..\n//<snip>\n\ntextureHeight = 1;\nvar size = textureWidth * textureHeight;\nvar dataColor = new Uint8Array( size * 3 );\nfor (var i = 0; i < size; i ++) {\n    dataColor[ i * 3 ]     = normalized[i].x;//R\n    dataColor[ i * 3 + 1 ] = normalized[i].y;//G\n    dataColor[ i * 3 + 2 ] = normalized[i].z;//B\n\n}\nvar map = new THREE.DataTexture(dataColor, textureWidth, textureHeight, THREE.RGBFormat );\nmap.needsUpdate = true;\n\nreturn map;\n```\n\nBut I'm getting confused with, because I'm having a lot of trouble to sample the values. How do I get the vertex values back in the shader? Do I really need to normalize the vertex values to 0..255? If yes, what math do I need to get the original vertex values in the shader?\n\nIn the shader, I'm doing something like this:\n\n``` glsl\nvec4 vertex = texture2D(plane_data, vec2(u, 0.0)); // \"u\" is a float I use to loop through the texture, knowing that the plane has only 32 vertexes.\n```\n\nI can upload the full source if needed, but it's rather big to read :(\n\nI hope I've explained my problem well. Thanks in advance.\n",

So if the y value of the mesh is 5 pixels, adding 1 moves it to 6. \n\nInstead of `translateY(delta/2)`, you should figure out how much the `mesh.scale.y += delta` physically increases/decreases the mesh, then you should translate by half that amount. \n"

However, it's not clear to me how the associated materials are added to the mesh. When I try to use the materials, the model just becomes black. I've looked at the obj_loader file in the example files, but I can't seem to trace down how it is assigning which materials to apply to the mesh and where. \n\nIn the example, there is a callback function specified in the loader variable declaration. That function calls createScene, and createScene creates a mesh. But the materials seem to just be new THREE.MeshFaceMaterial() function calls, not specific materials. I assume that means the .js file for the model is specifying those materials (seems to from the code), but how does it choose where to apply those materials and which to apply? If I swap out the obj js file in the example for my own, the model is black. Could this be some sort of scene lighting issue or something? Or maybe an error with the way the model was exported (from Maya)?\n\nWould love some help with trying to get this working. Thanks!\n",

Your object gets a callback and then it's up to you to keep filling the buffers with data till there are triangles to render and call this callback to render unindexed triangles (`gl.drawArrays`).\n\nThis is used for `MarchingCubes`.\n\n`BufferGeometry` (this is what's rendered via `renderBufferDirect`) is best suited for rendering large static geometries. You create one huge typed array buffer per attribute and store offsets into JS array. Then renderer renders these as indexed triangles (`gl.drawElements`), moving attribute pointers according to offsets.\n\nThis is used for CTM models.\n"

    "body": "Hi everybody, \n\nI succesfully managed to load and render a collada file including textures and a simple animation. This works great!\n\nHowever I'm not sure how to properly clone the object including the keyframe animation? Is it even necessary to clone the animation, or can it be shared among multiple objects? \n\nI'm using the code from the collada_keyframe example. My current approach looks like this:\n\n``` javascript\n    var animations, animHandler;\n    var kfAnimations = [];\n    var kfAnimationsLength = 0;\n\n    var source, copy;\n\n    var loader = new THREE.ColladaLoader();\n    loader.load('models/info.dae', function colladaReady( collada )\n    {\n        source = collada.scene;\n        copy = cloneObject(source);\n\n        source.position.y = -10;\n\n        animations = collada.animations;\n        kfAnimationsLength = animations.length;\n\n        animHandler = THREE.AnimationHandler;\n        for ( var i = 0; i < kfAnimationsLength; ++i )\n        {\n            var animation = animations[i];\n            animHandler.add(animation);\n\n            var kfAnimation = new THREE.KeyFrameAnimation(animation.node, animation.name);\n            kfAnimation.timeScale = 0.01;\n            kfAnimations.push(kfAnimation);\n\n            kfAnimation.play(true, 0);\n        }\n    } );\n\n    function initScene()\n    {\n        scene.add(copy);\n        scene.add(source);\n    }\n\n    function animate()\n    {\n        requestAnimFrame(animate);\n\n        for ( var i = 0; i < kfAnimationsLength; ++i )\n        {\n            kfAnimations[i].update(1);\n        }\n\n        render();\n    }\n```\n\nBoth objects are rendered, but only the source object is animated. I tried manually assigning the children of the copied object to the animations, but this really feels like the wrong approach:\n\n``` javascript\n        for ( var i = 0; i < kfAnimationsLength; ++i )\n        {\n            var kfAnimation = new THREE.KeyFrameAnimation(copy.children[i], animation.name);\n        }\n```\n\nHas anybody managed to clone an object including animations? And if yes, how would you control the animations separately for different instances of an object? It would be great if you guys could give me a hint on what I'm missing. Is there maybe an example around that I can study?\n\nCheers, \nMartin\n",

All of the object metadata and paths to the models are stored in an array (called objectData) within another array (called CONDITIONS) that has information about the pathological condition.\n\nI made a for loop to load the models in the selected pathological condition, but it seems that the JSONLoader runs asynchronously to my loop. As a result the labels and other metadata are attached to the wrong models. Tried using a variable as a parameter in the callback as suggested by alteredq in issue #314 but it didn't work because my loop finishes before the loader starts. Right now I have a patch solution of delaying the loading so that I can control the order, but it seems like there should be a way to identify the objects after they have loaded. Is this possible?\n\nHere is the part of my code (without the delay patch)\n\n``` javascript\nfunction loadObjects(){\n\nfor (var i in CONDITIONS[selectedCondition].objectData ){   \n        var j=0;        \n        var jsonLoader = new THREE.JSONLoader();\n        //alert ('outside of jsonLoader. i= ' + i + '; j= ' + j + '; ' + CONDITIONS[selectedCondition].objectData[i].url);\n\n        jsonLoader.load( CONDITIONS[selectedCondition].objectData[i].url, function( geometry ) { \n           var objectLoading= new THREE.Mesh( geometry, new THREE.MeshFaceMaterial() );     \n\n            //alert ('inside of jsonLoader. i= ' + i + '; j= ' + j);\n\n            objectLoading.myIndex=j;\n\n            //get the metadata from the objectData array\n            objectLoading.labelName=CONDITIONS[selectedCondition].objectData[j].name;\n            objectLoading.anatomy=CONDITIONS[selectedCondition].objectData[j].anatomy;\n            objectLoading.physiology=CONDITIONS[selectedCondition].objectData[j].physiology;\n\n            //call function to bind mouse events to object\n            bindEvents(objectLoading);  \n\n            group.add(objectLoading);\n\n            //store in objects array so that visibility can be turned off when switching pathological conditions\n            CONDITIONS[selectedCondition].objects[j]=objectLoading;\n\n            j++;\n\n        } );\n}\n}\n```\n\nNot sure if I explained this very well. I'm pretty new to all of this and could definitely use some advice. Thanks!\n",

It doesn't quite make sense to me why the for loop finishes before the jsonLoader starts, but that's what my alerts are showing.\n\nAnother idea is to use sceneLoader so that I know the name of each object and can match it with my metadata array, but this would mean a significant rewrite... :\\\n"

(Thanks for the whole three.js, actually :) )\n\nThis is what I was exactly wondering, to further clarify the issue:\nI used to export from 3dstudio max to a proprietary format of mine. This format kept face structure all in one FBO, and vertex structure in several FBOs, one per material. This way I could apply morph targets animation in one pass and then selectively render \"surfaces\" of the object, \"peeling\" them as needed (the classic example is a human body model with layered pants, shoes, hair etc. etc.)\n\nIs this kind of separation/visibility toggle - the same kind of mechanism?\nThanks a lot,\n\n r.\n"

I.e. the color created at construction \"sticks\" to the material, and subsequent changes just turn the line black...\n- using the canvas renderer, the changes are disregarded and only the first color sticks.\n\n``` javascript\n    function animate() {\n        requestAnimationFrame( animate );\n        render();\n    }\n\n   var material;\n\n   function render() {\n\n     // setting this to false creates a material\n     // with random color each frame\n     // (which works fine, just to show that\n     // the code has no major flaws)\n     var dynamicMaterialColor = true;\n\n     if (material === undefined || ! dynamicMaterialColor ) {\n       material = new THREE.LineBasicMaterial({\n         color: Math.floor(Math.random() * 16777216),\n       });\n     }\n     // if the material has already been created,\n     // re-use it and just change the color.\n     else {\n       // Attempting to change the color of the material.\n       // Commenting this line below shows that\n       // the first color *does* stick to the material.\n       // It's subsequent changes that turn the line\n       // black.\n       material.color = Math.floor(Math.random() * 16777216);\n     }\n\n    // just creates the geometry of the line. \n    var geometry = new THREE.Geometry();\n     geometry.vertices.push(new THREE.Vertex(new THREE.Vector3(-20, 0, 0)));\n     geometry.vertices.push(new THREE.Vertex(new THREE.Vector3(20, 0, 0)));\n\n    // creates the line object and add to scene\n     var line = new THREE.Line(geometry, material);\n     scene.add(line);\n\n     renderer.render(scene, camera);\n\n     // remove the line from scene, just to be clean\n     scene.remove(scene.objects[0]);\n\n   }\n```\n",

But when I try to use a higher order function as the callback function:\n\n``` javascript\nvar create_loadAttachmentPoint = function(attachmentPointName) {\n    var loadAttachmentPoint = function(attachmentPoint_geometry) {\n        var attachmentpoint_material = new THREE.MeshPhongMaterial();\n        attachmentpoint_material.color = new THREE.Color().setRGB(1,1,1);\n        attachmentpoint_material.ambient = new THREE.Color().setRGB(0.0196078431372549,0.0196078431372549,0.0196078431372549);\n        attachmentpoint_material.specular = new THREE.Color().setRGB(0.06666666666666667,0.06666666666666667,0.06666666666666667);\n\n        this[attachmentPointName] = new THREE.Mesh(attachmentPoint_geometry, attachmentpoint_material);\n        scene.add( this[attachmentPointName] );\n    }\n    return loadAttachmentPoint;\n}\n\nvar attachmentPointA_loader = new THREE.JSONLoader();\nattachmentPointA_loader.load(\"attachmentpoint2.js\", create_loadAttachmentPoint(\"attachmentPointA\"));\n```\n\nsomething goes wrong. My line of code further down:\n\n``` javascript\nattachmentPointA.position.set(-42.62877442273525,2.239641657334812,49.27211646136609);\n```\n\nspits out an error message, \"Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'position' of undefined\". The weird thing is though that when I try to access attachmentPointA from the console, it actually is defined, and it has all of the properties that it should have, including position. I can't figure out why my code can't access the object but I can. My hunch would be that I'm misusing the \"this\" pointer, but when I check in the chrome console it has successfully added attachmentPointA to the window and not to the JSONLoader object. This may be a very newbie error I am making, but I can't figure it out.\n\nThank you very much for any help!\n",

When the basic texture was applied to them they rotated smoothly, though now I have added a very simple circle png image to them, the very small stars flicker profusely.

Assuming dae.children is the scene (from THREE.Scene) or the ColladaLoader result.scene since you have used \"dae\". I think you need an array of objects to check, so you need to build it up from the scene, for example a recursive way:\n\n``` JavaScript\nvar intersectList = [];\n\nfunction buildIntersectList(sceneChild, list) {\n  for (var i = 0, il = sceneChild.length; i < il; ++i) {\n    var obj = sceneChild[i];\n    list.push(obj);\n\n    if (obj.children.length > 0) {\n      buildIntersectList(obj.children, list);\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nbuildIntersectList(dae.children, intersectList);\nvar intersects = ray.intersectObjects( intersectList );\n```\n\nDoes that work for you? You may also need to call ray.setPrecision if your geometry is really small and missing intersections. Credit for this really goes to the Kuda project, I just looked at what we did.\n\nBest wishes\n"

When I open my stl file with \"blender\", I remark that my object is not localised at the center of the frame. Indeed, he is at (10,22,30) for example. So, the object in my navigator is at the same position that in \"blender\". So, I translate it with some calculation at the center of the landmark. BUT ^^, I remark that the attribute \"position\" of the object had values (0,0,0) at the initial position (before I translate it at the center of the frame, so (0,0,0) = (10,22,30) in obsolute frame), consequently after the translation, the object has position (-10,-22,-30). When I try to use setRotation(a), to rotate my object, it rotates around HIS origin that is to say (10,22,30) !!! How can I rotate my object on itself ? I would like that the center of the rotation be the center of the frame. I would like a function where I can specify the center of rotation.\n\nDavid\n",

But I have an other constraint :/\n\nThanks mrdoob mesh.geometry.applyMatrix( new THREE.Matrix4().setTranslation( -10,-22,-30 ) ) was useful to apply transformation on my objet. :)\n\nBut I have a particular case, indeed my objects have specifics positions compared to others. I have a bone with anatomical points, when I load bones and anatomical points, they are automatically position on the bone at strategic position for future calculations.  If I move everything with THREE.GeometryUtils.center( geometry ) I loose the position of anatomicals points.\nIf I use mesh.geometry.applyMatrix( new THREE.Matrix4().setTranslation( -10,-22,-30 ) ) I keep the relative position of my objects but the position (0,0,0) of my object corresponds to the initial position of it. So when I use this.object.geometry.applyMatrix(this.object.matrix.setRotationY( Math.PI/2) ); I turn around the relative position of the object (0,0,0) and not the absolute position which must be the center of the frame (0,0,0). I need to be able to specify the center of the rotation or to be in the case where the center of rotation is the center of the frame and that my objects keep the relative position to other object. I need to move all objects like a same unity on the center of the frame.\n\nI hope that my explications are clear ^^ \n"

But when you don't, the rendered frame will remain without texture.\n\nHopefully, such behavior can be reproduced by replacing animate() in examples/webgl_loader_collada.html on line 43 with render().\n\nI did not find any issues on that and I am not sure if I got the thing right.\n\nThanks again.\n",

    "body": "Good day,\n\nI'm working on a raytracer to try to add photorealism to the scenes. At first, I tried using THREE.Ray to shoot the rays through each pixel and get the interceptions with the available methods, and it worked really well, but sadly it is very slow to shoot a ray through every pixel (it really takes like 4-5 min to shoot a ray through every pixel even on lower resolution like 400x400). \n\nSo I had another idea, that is, to use shaders to shoot the rays and calculate every color change on the scenario. But since ray-tracing is a global ilumination method, then I'd need to have a global shader for the whole scene.\n\nSo...my question is, is there a way to use a global shader for every object in the scene? From the examples I've been watching, all of them need to have a THREE.shaderMaterial associated with an object, so the shaders can be applied to that object alone, but in this case I'll need to do it globally.\n\nNot sure if I explained it very well, but I'd love an opinion on this. Thanks in advance.\n",

Load objects to the scene, and set up lights, define camera.\n2. Start shooting rays through each pixel in the camera, look for intersections.\n3. If there's an intersection with an object, calculate refraction based on the normal, and type of material.\n4. Follow the new refracted ray, if it hits another object, get the point that was hit, and change the color, based on the previous parameters.\n5. Repeat step 3 a certain number of times.\n\nSo, the problem is on step 4, how would I update the shaderMaterial that way, or how would I change that _specific_ object on global shader?\n"

    "body": "Hello there,\nI've been playing with Three.js and wonder if there is a way to make FirstPersonControls (or any other method/class/obj) behave more \"Quake-like\".\n\nI see two issues:\n1. The camera keeps moving even if the mouse is not. Is there a way to change that behavior and get the camera moving (looking around) only when the mouse moves? I looked through FirstPersonControls source code but couldn't find a way to accomplish that without recoding. (running r46, btw)\n1. The camera always moves in the direction we are looking at. This works great to simulate a flying camera (or user) but makes it harder to simulate a person walking around a map. Is there a way to get the camera to move only on the XZ plane (simulating walking) while it's free to \"look around\" without re-coding? In time: making lookVertical = false helps but doesn't really solve the problem because it kills looking up and down.\n\nAny tips/ideas/suggestions are mostly welcome.\n- rod\n",

However it still doesn't reflect on the loaded model. I have a render loop going too using requestAnimationFrame(). Not sure what I'm doing wrong. \n\nThe other issue is that Firefox for some reason shows all my loaded collada files completely black in color. Surprisingly the \"ambient\" and \"color\" properties on the meshes show as {r:1,g:1,b:1} & the color respectively. Not sure whats wrong with that.\n\nIs there any care I have to take while exporting the model from MAX? I'm using OpenCollada at the moment.\n\nThanks\n",

(I suppose it does, otherwise they wouldn't be separate settings, but I can't think of such a case.)\n\nYes, you could have your assets already in linear space (in: `false`, out: `true`) or if you want to do also postprocessing in linear space, then you would keep the output in linear space (in: `true`, out: `false`) and do gamma correction manually just at the end of postprocessing chain.\n\n> What if there are no texture images involved in the application? Should these parameters be true, anyway?\n\nAs you prefer. Again this depends on the whole asset pipeline and rendering pipeline and what \"look\" do you want to have. It doesn't matter if textures are involved or not, material colors themselves can be in linear or gamma space.\n\n> If gamma renderer.gammaInput = true, then should you always convert shader colors like so? (It's not always done in this way in the examples when renderer.gammaInput = true.)\n\nIt depends on in which color space you will author the content. \n\nIf you already work in linear space, no need for conversion (that's probably what happens in these examples, colors tweaked already in the browser WYSIWYG). \n\nIf you get assets that were created in gamma space, then you would need to do the conversion.\n\nThis whole topic is somehow messy and inprecise, as in many cases we don't know how the assets were created. If you would create bigger project from scratch, then you would need to take care that everything is set up consistently. \n\nI think modern games try to do everything in linear space, their content creation tools work in linear space and output linear space data, engine does everything in linear space and just at the very end it applies gamma correction.\n\nIf you just use random content from the web, most likely it was authored in gamma space and you need to convert it into linear space before shading.\n"

Just you would need to experiment and measure, to see when it becomes cheaper to merge than to deal with many tiny things (practical limit is about 5,000 - 7,000 draw calls per frame, this with trivial materials, more uniforms and more attributes, more overhead for even very simple objects).\n"

And even one step more strangely :D in the above version when I console.log the respecitve positions of the vertices they will increase, but they are not updated for presentation.\n\ncould someone tell me what I am overseeing here, please?? :D I would be really grateful! :)\n\nmike\n",

But one triangle ist right colored, the other one is black.\nIt seems, that not the defined normals are used, but the normals are calculated by the winding of the vertices. What do I have to change to use the defined normals? Reason: I have a large set of triangles with switching windings.

So i think it's not a too much polygons lag.\n\nMy first thought was \"ok, it needs to calculate texture because I clone, offset them and they needsupdate\" so i tried to build and add the next floor before it arrives (when you look at the first one) but the frame drop occured when new floor arrives on screen and not during the build or the add... \nI don't know if there's a method or property to force render off screen objects or do I miss something ?\n\nThanks again for this awesome framework and sorry for my bad english...\n",

If you don't have the right combination, it will not work. \n\nBy default, everything is set up to be quite robust, but once you start messing with custom values you may create invalid combinations (e.g. any filter with name containing \"mipmap\" must have mipmap and also image must be power-of-2 sized, which leaves you with just nearest and linear filters if you turn off mipmaps).\n"

As I'm using the CanvasRenderer, the blocks look fine while the floor isn't good enough (I understand the issues with affine transformations which makes this so). \n\nSo, when the user wants to save their view, my intention is to turn off the floor, upload a PNG of just the 3D blocks to the server, then re-render the floor on the server using ImageMagick by distorting the floor image, and then I can add the canvas-rendered block image on top. \n\nThe problem I have is this: I can't figure out how to get the 2D screen co-ordinates of my floor out of the 3D space. If I can get these, then I can pass them to ImageMagick to distort the image appropriately. \n\nAny help is appreciated. Thanks in advance!\n",

Now I need to make it collidable with other objects. JigLibJS2 supports triangle objects and because the plane is actually created by bunch of triangles this shouldn't be that hard. But it is. \n\nI need to get vertices and indices of every triangle in the plane. So I can create invisible JigLibJS2 triangle objects and set their moveable properties to false. Any idea?\n\nBTW there is a similar issue here. Maybe it helps to understand how to create JigLibJS2 triangle meshes: #602\n",

The problem is that all the models are positioned the same. i.e. they are all at {x:6, y:0, z:0}\n\nI'm thinking this is because the loading of the meshes is asynchronous and the loop finishes before the positions are set. How can i enter the positions on mesh load? In other words wait until the mesh has loaded into the scene and then position them?\n\n``` javascript\n\nfor (var x = 0; x < Models.length; x++)\n{\n    JSONLoader.load(\"../assets/models/\" + Models[x], function(Geometry)\n    {\n        Mesh = new THREE.Mesh(Geometry, DarkMaterial);\n        Mesh.position.set(x, 0, 0);\n        Scene.add(Mesh);\n    });\n}\n\n```\n\nAt the minute i'm doing something uncool like this:\n\n``` javascript\n\nfor (var x = 0; x < Scene.objects.length; x = x + 2)\n{\n    Scene.objects[x].position.set((x / 2) - 2.5, 0, 0);\n    Scene.objects[x].rotation.y += 0.01;\n\n    Scene.objects[x + 1].position.set((x / 2) - 2.5, -2, 0);\n    Scene.objects[x + 1].rotation.y += 0.01;\n}\n\n```\n\nAny ideas?\n",

I haven't really noticed a difference in FPS when I switched to POT dimensions.\n\nLike with everything, you need to have use case where particular thing becomes bottleneck. In this case it's dealing with lots and/or big textures.\n\nMost notable example was ro.me where for video textures this made a big difference, especially when combining several of them. Also I remember virtual online gallery which was noticeably slower with lots of NPOT textures.\n\nThough even if you don't get bad performance, you may still want to have POT textures to be able to have mipmaps and nicer filtering (with NPOT you can have just `nearest` and `linear` filters).\n"

I am currently writing a little game with a JSON model. I use 'scene.addObject(mesh)' within the callback-function of a THREE.JSONLoader to add the model to the scene. Everything works fine, but I am not able to change the position of the mesh within the animate function (taken from the examples) or anywhere else. It seems to me that this is a behavior of the scene.addObject function. Meshes that I have added with scene.add are movable and rotatable, but using this function on a mesh that is loaded out of a JSON-file does not work. \n",

If not: might it be an idea to include it?\n\n``` javascript\nobject.position.distanceToAxis('y', target.position);\n```\n\n(of course assuming they have the same parent or `target` is the parent)\n",

I want to be able to get the rotation angle(s) of the camera.\n\nI have tried querying camera.rotation, but it always returns (0,0,0) - presumably because RollControls uses matrices to perform the rotations and movement.\n\nWhat is the best practice for getting x, y, and z rotation angles for the camera in this case?\n",

Can you give me an example of its usage?\n\nHere's my use case: I want to create a rotating compass as part of the UI for my game.  An entity is facing North when it has a `rotation.y` of 0.  I want to convert the result of `setRotationFromMatrix()` to a 0-360 degree angle value.\n\nI have tried this:\n\n``` javascript\ndummy = new THREE.Object3D();\nscene.add(dummy);\n\n// following code is called in an update loop\ndummy.rotation.setRotationFromMatrix( camera.matrix );\nvar rad = dummy.rotation.y;\nvar deg = rad * 180 / Math.PI;\n```\n\nIt appears that the `rotation.y` value from `setRotationFromMatrix()` is 0 when facing North OR South, approx. 1.56 when facing West, and approx. -1.56 when facing East.  Is this supposed to be a radians value?  When I convert it to degrees as per the above, I only get a 180 degree range before the degree value starts to return to zero.\n\nThis is a mixture of uncertainty over the Three.js types and my own poor maths, but I appear to be missing something vital.

But I can't figure what the masks are for and how to render multiple composers on multiple scenes.\n\nI created 3 scenes with 3 different composers.\n\nIn the first scene : my skybox with its own camera perspective\nIn the second one : a sphere with its own camera\nin the third : another sphere using the same camera as the second scene\n\nSo I can add some bloom or fxaa on the object of scene 3 separatly from scene 2 and the skybox.\nThe problem is that I can only render 1 composer of 1 scene. The last composer.render() of the render function actually. It seems logical to me but I can't find an example or issue to teach me how to do it properly.\n\nBasicaly I would like to render the composer1 (the skybox) and then composer2 (sphere with a nice fxaa without any bloom) and finally composer 3 (the other sphere with a little bloom on it without fxaa).\n\nMaybe I have got it backward.

Why does the aspect ratio change when you're rotating an object?\n\nThe aspect ration should only change i you resize the viewport, and then you need to update the projectionMatrix of the camera.

    "body": "hey knowledgeable folks,\n\nI have a question to ask to you, concerning the Geometry class and its derivates:\n\nWhat do I have to take into account if I want to design my own Geometry-subclass (just like CubeGeometry.js, SphereGeometry.js etc.) and especially: in what order are the vertices stored inside the Geometry-own vertices-array resp. what order do the vertex-indices have inside the array?\n\nI am computing the vertices of my new geometry with polar coordinates by running through 2 for-loops that in turn increment the respective phi angle (around z-axis) and theta angle (around y-axis) from which the radius of the respective vertex is computed (with a formula). After that I push the respective vertex into the Geometry's inner vertices-array. Coordinates are all valid and vertices are successfully pushed into the array, but my problem is that their indices seem to be in an order that I do not quite understand yet.\n\nAs the order of the vertex-indices is crucial for the correct arrangement of faces (obviously), I would be very happy if one of you skillful guys could tell me - after looking at my code - in what order I have to imagine the vertices and arrange them in the respective faces. Here is the code that lies in the file src/extras/geometries/MyGeometry.js:\n\n``` javascript\nTHREE.MyGeometry = function ( params, phi_range, phi_res, theta_range, theta_res ) {\n\n    THREE.Geometry.call( this );\n\n    var scope = this;\n\n   // here some for the issue irrelevant stuff was commented out\n   this.params = default_settings;\n\n    this.phi_range = phi_range || 180.0;\n    this.phi_res = phi_res || 180.0;\n\n    this.theta_range = theta_range || 360.0;\n    this.theta_res = theta_res || 360.0;\n\n    var uvs = [];\n\n    function radius(phi, params...) {\n        ... working fine!\n    }\n\n    function getVertexOfSuperShape(theta, params..., phi, params...) {\n        var cos_theta = Math.cos(theta),\n            sin_theta = Math.sin(theta),\n            cos_phi = Math.cos(phi),\n            sin_phi = Math.sin(phi),\n            radius_theta = radius(theta, params...),\n            radius_phi = radius(phi, params...),\n            x = radius_theta * cos_theta * radius_phi * cos_phi,\n            y = radius_theta * sin_theta * radius_phi * cos_phi,\n            z = radius_phi * sin_phi;\n\n        return new THREE.Vector3(x, y, z).multiplyScalar(100);\n    }\n\n    var phi_step_size = this.phi_range / this.phi_res;\n    var theta_step_size = this.theta_range / this.theta_res;\n\n    for (var phi_i = 0; phi_i < this.phi_res; phi_i++) {\n        var phi = -(this.phi_range / 2) + phi_i * phi_step_size;\n\n        for (var theta_i = 0; theta_i < this.theta_res; theta_i++) {\n            var theta = -(this.theta_range / 2) + theta_i * theta_step_size;\n            var vector = getVertexOfSuperShape(theta, params, phi, params);\n\n            this.vertices.push(new THREE.Vertex(vector));\n\n            // I AM QUITE UNSURE ABOUT HOW TO COMPUTE THE RIGHT UVs\n            uvs.push( new THREE.UV( theta_i / this.theta_res, 1 - phi_i / this.phi_res ) );\n        }\n    }\n\n    for (var phi_i = 0; phi_i < this.phi_res; phi_i++) {\n        for (var theta_i = 0; theta_i < this.theta_res; theta_i++) {\n            var next_phi_i, next_theta_i;\n\n            if (phi_i = this.phi_res - 1) {\n                next_phi_i = 0;\n            }\n            else {\n                next_phi_i = phi_i + 1;\n            }\n\n            if (theta_i = this.theta_res - 1) {\n                next_theta_i = 0;\n            }\n            else {\n                next_theta_i = theta_i + 1;\n            }\n\n            var a = phi_i * this.theta_res + theta_i;\n        var b = phi_i * this.theta_res + next_theta_i;\n        var c = next_phi_i * this.theta_res + theta_i;\n\n\n        var face = new THREE.Face3(a, b, c);\n        this.faces.push( face );\n\n        this.faceVertexUvs[ 0 ].push( [ uvs[ a ].clone(), uvs[ b ].clone(), uvs[ c ].clone()] );\n        }\n    }\n\n    this.computeCentroids();\n\n};\n\nTHREE.MyGeometry.prototype = new THREE.Geometry();\nTHREE.MyGeometry.prototype.constructor = THREE.MyGeometry;\n```\n\nI would really be happy if someone could give me a hint at this and I am always happy about tips about whatelse to consider when making a stable new geometry class (concerning normals, uvs etc.!)\n\nThanks a lot in advance! :)\n\nVelvetValve\n",

Basically the client keeps a record of movements/changes it generates (player walks, turns, shoots) and sends those to the server. The server checks everything and sends those commands to all clients. As a command is received by a client it coordinates the command with it's own local changes (based on timestamp) and replays all local changes which haven't been server-processed yet.\n\nObviously, the level of event-security you need depends on what you're doing. In Call of Duty it is vital to keep track of \"Player 1 shot before Player 2 did\" and replay the events accordingly. Other applications are less sensitive.\n"

The position and rotation values of the object3Ds are relative to the parent, but I'd also like to be able to display the absolute values of those object3Ds.\n\nWhen only translations of the parents are involved it is pretty easy to define the absolute values as it is just a shift for the position but it is when rotations are also included that I'm kinda lost!\n\nThanks for your time. \n",

There has to be a proper way doing this. Can you help me, please?\n\nWhat I'm actually trying to do is a tilemap with 16x16 planes. I want to be able to modify the y-position of every plane dynamically.\n",

    "body": "Hi all!\nim exporting a scene from blender using the blender python script and i have some questions about how material loading is implemented. \nIm my test case, I have a scene file with some meshes in separated files (like the blender scene in the examples)\nI've been debugging sceneLoader.js and loader.js code and i see that the way three.js loads materials is something like this:\n1. SceneLoader loads the materials defined in the scene file and puts them in Result.Materials. These materials are default materials (depending on the material type) plus some (usually few) new properties.\n2. For each geometry, Loader.js loads the materials inside the file. These materials (in the blender exporter case) have more properties than the ones loaded in the scene file, but have the same names (in my case)\n3. For each model in the scene file, it uses the referenced geometry (loaded from the geometry file) and the material FROM THE SCENE FILE, so the geometry material is not used. I also noticed that most of the scene's material properties are created from default values and not exported from the original materials (these values are correct in the geometry file),\n\nSo the questions are these:\n1. Why materials from geometry files are not used? I guess a model instance could use a different material...\n2. If this is correct, blender exporter should create more complex material files in scene file, is this correct?\n\nOne solution could be to have a material on geometry file and the material in scene file could modify some of the properties of this 'geometry material'\n\nI dont know if Im missing something...  I think the relation between materials in geometries an scenes is not very clear...\n\nThank you!\n",

Perhaps exporters should break meshes with multi materials in independent meshes, or perhaps a better solution could be insert a 'model' class just over 'mesh' so a model could have multimple meshes with only one material per mesh.\nHaving only one material per mesh could improve the way meshes are orderer for optimizing GL state changes....\nThis is a common problem in 3d engines :-S\n\nThese are just a few ideas, perhaps not the best ones :-)\n"

It works but it's more pain to deal with.\n\nThough this is mostly question of asset pipeline, internally we anyway have to split everything into single material triangle batches, that's how OpenGL ES works. \n\nAnd sorting is tricky in any case, you have different things you could sort for, often conflicting - transparency, depth, shader, buffers. Plus sorting itself in JavaScript brings non-trivial overhead.\n\nI plan to eventually look closer into this, just this is non-trivial thing. I know there can be big performance differences, tricky part is how not to screw some use cases when improving other ones.\n\nFor the moment, deep guts of `WebGLRenderer` are constructed in a way that if you don't do silly things when constructing the scene (like alternating geometries / materials), it should mostly work quite close to optimal performance (very little unnecessary stuff sent to GL).\n"

    "body": "Hello people,\n\nFirst of all, thanks alot for Three.js! It is certainly user (noob) friendly!\n\nThen to the issue. I am trying to find the Geometry or Mesh of a loaded Collada Model. Because I want to adapt the camera to the most outer vertices of the model. So far, i have found the geometry for the example collada model (examples/models/monster.dae) in collada.scene.geometry, if I am correct. But for some other models, it does not work.\n(where collada is the argument that is passed to the callback function of THREE.ColladaLoader.load() )\n\nBasically i have stripped the webgl_collada.html example to it's basics, displaying the model. Now when I want to load another model, it sometimes does find the geometry under collada.scene, and sometimes not.\n(I am new here, and dont know how to attach or provide examples now, sorry)\n\nIs there a general place where the geometry or something like that is saved in a collada model?\n\nAlso, have absolutely no knowledge of models, could anyone give a small explanation as to what the difference between a Geometry and a Mesh is?\n\nEvery piece of help is greatly appreciated!! Thanks!\n\nYixx\n",

It all works great but now I need to get the rotation of the camera, however its is always set to x:0 y:0 z:0\n\nI haven't added it to my scene as I assume I'm not meant to. I have tried it but makes no difference.\n\nPlease can someone tell me how to get the camera rotation.\n\nThank you\n",

I now want to add a person/character/image in front of the camera to represent the person navigating the plane.  When the user moves with the keyboard or mouse, I want the image to stay centered in front of the camera.\n\nWhat's the best way to proceed with this?  I tried creating a sprite, and adding that to the controls, but that just moves the sprite around.\n\nAny ideas would be greatly appreciated.  Should I\n1)  Continue with using the sprite, and get the camera to reposition in controls update function?  'this.object.lookAt( targetPosition );' does not work properly, and mouse left and right movement does not work.\n2)  Keep the camera attached to the controls, and then move the sprite to where the camera currently is?\n3)  Something completely different?\n\nI then also want to add collision detection between that image and wall textures, etc. that I have added.  Do I need to create a bounding mesh for this as well, or can I just create a ray from the image?\n\nDan\n",

I have previously used that to calculate position from local space to a parents space, like this: \n\n``` javascript\nvar childWorldMatrix = childMesh.matrixWorld;\nvar tempParentMatrix = new THREE.Matrix4();\nvar inverse = new THREE.Matrix4();\nTHREE.Matrix4.makeInvert(scene.matrixWorld,inverse);\ntempParentMatrix.multiply(inverse,childWorldMatrix );\nspotLight.position = tempParentMatrix.getPosition();\n```\n\nIs there perhaps a smarter way of doing this? Some build-in function?\n\n/Einar\n",

I expected something like coordinates for the texture JPEG file. Similar to \"vt 454 232\" for the pixel X = 454 Y = 232 in the texture JPEG file. \n\nIn the convert_obj_three.py file is the following part: \n\n```\n        # Texture coordinates in (u,v[,w]) coordinates, w is optional\n        # vt 0.500 -1.352 [0.234]\n        if chunks[0] == \"vt\" and len(chunks) >= 3:\n            u = float(chunks[1])\n            v = float(chunks[2])\n            w = 0\n            if len(chunks)>3:\n                w = float(chunks[3])\n            uvs.append([u,v,w])\n```\n\nBut I can not find the part where the converter uses these informations to extract the color infos from the texture file.

    "body": "Hi guys,\nFirst I want to thank you all for your amazing work.\nI downloaded the r43 a couple of days ago and tried to get started with Three.js. I created a simple plane, added a texture and called it sky. Next I made the scene itself resizable. So far so good. I tried to find out how to update the vertices of a mesh, because I want to resize the sky as well. I added 2 lines of code and one of them seems to break everything. _geom.dynamic = true_ is fine, but uncommenting  ___dirtyVertices = true_ makes my sky disappear.\n\n``` javascript\nif ( ! Detector.webgl ) Detector.addGetWebGLMessage();\n\nvar container,\n    camera, scene, renderer,\n    skyMesh, skyGeom, skyMat;\n\ninit();\nanimate();\n\nfunction init() {\n  container = document.createElement('div');\n  document.body.appendChild(container);\n\n  camera = new THREE.Camera( 45, window.innerWidth / window.innerHeight, 1, 2000 );\n  camera.position.z = 800;\n\n  scene = new THREE.Scene();\n\n  skyGeom = new THREE.PlaneGeometry( window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight, 1, 1 );\n  skyGeom.dynamic = true;\n\n  skyMat = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial( { map: THREE.ImageUtils.loadTexture( 'textures/sky.jpg' ) } );\n  skyMesh = new THREE.Mesh( skyGeom, skyMat ); \n  scene.addObject( skyMesh );\n\n  renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer();\n  renderer.setSize( window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight );\n\n  container.appendChild( renderer.domElement );\n}\n\nfunction animate() {\n  requestAnimationFrame( animate );\n  render();\n}\n\nfunction render() {\n  // here we go :(\n  // skyMesh.skyGeom.__dirtyVertices = true;\n\n  renderer.render( scene, camera );\n}\n\nwindow.addEventListener( 'resize', onWindowResize, false );\n\nfunction onWindowResize() {\n  camera.aspect = window.innerWidth / window.innerHeight;\n  camera.updateProjectionMatrix();\n\n  renderer.setSize( window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight );\n}\n```\n\nI'm almost entirely sure I miss something, or just made some kind of stupid mistake. And I'm pretty sure most of you guys know what to do. Thank you! Oh btw, just setting the bools and not actually update any vertices should just work right? As far as I understand it's just like a dynamic VBO - slower than a static VBO but still just a VBO.\n",

I took a look at some of the collision examples, but most of the stuff with rays and projection just went way over my head. I figured something like this would be a great example to include with the default package.\n\nSo, my question is: how can I overwrite the camera's translate method such that it will check for any blocks in the path of movement, and then prevent the camera from moving into a block in its path?\n",

But if you do the opposite render order, second object will be missing normals buffer.\n\nWorkarounds are: \n1. be careful about order of creation / initialization to have most complex materials first or \n2. use non-shared geometries for objects which have materials requiring different buffers (besides lit/unlit it's also for example smooth / flat normals).\n"

The way I do something like this is I have a function that I call when I'm setting up the scene that takes care of all the setup for the TrackballControls:\n\n``` javascript\nfunction initTrackballControls(){\n    // The controller that lets us spin around the world      \n    controls = new THREE.TrackballControls( camera , renderer.domElement);\n    //controls = new THREE.OrbitControls(camera, renderer.domElement);\n    // controls.target = new THREE.Vector3(0,0,0);\n    controls.rotateSpeed = 3.5;\n    controls.zoomSpeed = 3;\n    controls.panSpeed = 2;\n    controls.noZoom = false;\n    controls.noPan = false;       //We don't want to pan around the galaxy, we're focused around the sun.\n    controls.staticMoving = true;\n    controls.dynamicDampingFactor = 0.3;\n    controls.keys = [ 65, 83, 68];    //Keys: A => Rotate, S => Zoom (Pan not used :. = -1)\n    controls.minDistance = 500;     //Closest we can get to the Sun a\n    controls.maxDistance = 4000;    //Let you figure this one out...\n}\n```\n\nThen, in the button-triggered function you had you can put `controls = undefined` and set your positions without being interrupted.

Sometimes I need to hit refresh 3-4 times until all of the objects are visible.\n\nI read in some old issue that if you add a child to an object that was already added to the scene, the object (or child or both, not sure anymore) won't be visible. I guess that was fixed because I add the objects to the scene before and after I added children to it, for testing, and in both cases all objects and children were visible.\n\nBut, I was wondering if there is still some bug there or if there was like a good/right way or sequence to add the objects with children to the scene. \n\nOr maybe it has something to do with my PC? It isn't fast enough, graphics sucks? my scripts sucks? xD\nI haven't test them in others PC, I'll do that later today and post here whatever I get  :-)\n\nI'll appreciate any comments =)\nRegards, \nJulio\n",

For example:\n\n``` javascript\nvar parts = { count: 0, objects: {} };\nvar partsTotal = 4;\n\nloader.load( { model: \"part1.js\", callback: function( geometry ) { callback( geometry, \"part1\" ) } } );\nloader.load( { model: \"part2.js\", callback: function( geometry ) { callback( geometry, \"part2\" ) } } );\nloader.load( { model: \"part3.js\", callback: function( geometry ) { callback( geometry, \"part3\" ) } } );\nloader.load( { model: \"parent.js\", callback: function( geometry ) { callback( geometry, \"parent\" ) } } );\n\nfunction callback( geometry, id ) {\n\n  parts.objects[ id ] = createObject( geometry );\n  parts.count ++;\n\n  if ( parts.count == partsTotal ) {\n     createHierarchy();\n  }\n\n}\n\nfunction createObject( geometry ) {\n\n  var object = new THREE.Mesh( geometry, new THREE.MeshFaceMaterial() );\n  return object;\n\n}\n\nfunction createHierarchy() {\n\n    var parent = parts.objects[ \"parent\" ];\n    parent.addChild( parts.objects[ \"part1\" ] );\n    parent.addChild( parts.objects[ \"part2\" ] );\n    parent.addChild( parts.objects[ \"part3\" ] );\n\n}\n```\n\nYou could chain load requests (if I understood well, that's what you do now) but then all loading would take longer, as objects wouldn't be loaded in parallel.\n"

Then merge all geometries using GeometryUtils.merge\n\nI would expect (2) to perform much better than (1), but it is much worse... Is this due to the fact that the geometry is split into geometrygroups depending on material? I'm looking to extend this to a large number of meshes (1500~2000) and would expect to need them to be merged all into one mesh for performance reasons? The material is essentially the same program across all faces, except for the texture used...\n\nIf I merge all the meshes, would it make sense to also merge the different textures somehow (on a canvas?) and index this large texture (but how)?\n\nUPDATE: I've been looking at this from a Javascript profiler perspective, and it seems the biggest culprit is the repeated updateObject calls which iterates over all geometrygroups of the merged mesh to see if anything needs to be done. When I instrument this function to only be evaluated once, performance improves quite a bit (but not enough). Now (1) and (2) seem to be on par at about 30 frames per second. I guess that this basically now boils down to doing the same things: rendering every mesh, or rendering every geometrygroup... One option would be to bypass all the program updates, except for the texture buffer (or go with a mega-texture)?\n\nthanks for any pointers!\nkind regards.\n",

My current project requires me to include several different types of movement for the camera, and I'm unsure to what degree these have already been done and where I can start building the appropriate additions. Specifically I need to know how to change the direction of the camera. That is, instead of focusing on a single point to look in a specific direction.\n\nMy guess on how to implement this would be to fake it by using sets of points at a specific distance from the camera. However my attempts at changing the camera focus position so far have had no effect on the direction, so I'm stumped.\n\nI'd appreciate any help getting this to work. Thanks!\n",

Both come from different databases and the Z coordinates do not necessarily line up. So I'd like to clamp (project) the road to the terrain to avoid any inconsistencies.\n\nWe're talking potentially very large meshes here, so I'd like to avoid doing this all in javascript (doing bilinear interpolation for the 4 terrain vertices around each road vertex or so). Is there any way this can be done in the road's vertex shader or so? This might be wishful thinking, but any pointers would be greatly appreciated.\n\nthanks!!\n",

As far as I can tell, the other geometries dont support MeshFaceMaterial().\n\nI need to set the color of the top circle faces of a cylinder and half of it to transparent, the bottom to the background color and the other half to black for example in order to make another cylinder (a black one, which also has the bottom face and a half a of it set to transparent) look like it has a hole or it's been cut. I could also use a Torus, then I'd need to make a bit part of it transparent and use a cilinder under it (which also has some faces set to the torus color and some to the blackground color) to make the torus look like it's been cut.\n\nI've tried doing what an example does to a \"Icosahedron\" to see if i can get the faces of a cylinder or torus, but I havent got any luck :( ... \n\nI've thought about geting a model of such half/hole cylinder/torus. But I havent give it a try. Maybe some of you guys have some advises on the matter xD\n\nThanks\nJulio\n",

Is it possible to have these meshes cast shadows? I've tried digging through the ShadowVolume code, and it seems that it makes use of edgefaces to calculate the stencil shadows? I'm not that familiar with the calculations involved, but I've seen some rather funky shadows being cast on a plane below my ribbon. This is probably due to my lack of understanding of how these things work, but any advice would be welcome (I also noticed that a plane does not cast shadows, which is probably part of the answer).\n\nSecondly, I would like to be able to color every face of my ribbon in a different color. Does that mean I have to assign a different material to every face as I'm constructing it? (this seems to cause quite the slowdown)\n\nyour help is much appreciated,\nkind regards.\n",

I have a helicopter which I want to do a couple of rotations on, in sequence- so I wish to make it tilt forward relative to speed, then rotate the result of that on the y axis so it points in the correct direction.  Currently this doesn't work as I'm simply setting the x/y of my rotation, and they are being executed in no specific order, meaning even if my helicopter is going left, it's still tilted as though it was travelling forward!  Is there any way I can imply an order to my rotations?  Reading around it looks like I might need to either use quaternions or matrices- are there any examples of this anywhere I can refer to?\n\nCheers!\n\nShaw.\n",

Would it be to group up the parts, and export each individually to obj files then use the convert_obj_threejs_slim.py script, load each one individually and reconstruct everything in code?  This is what I'm considering as I have a helicopter with moving rotor's guns etc.\n\nIt would be awesome if, for example, the car demo showed the wheels moving, so we could see how to load and deal with models built of multiple parts.\n\nIf someone could let me know if I'm going down the right path, or if there is a way i could export the model as is and import, maintaining the hierarchy of the model\n",

    "body": "Hi Richard,\n  First I want to thank you for Three.js.  It's a work of art!  I tried running the voxels demo setting the opacity of the plane to 1.  In doing that, the plane will cover up either the entire cube or a subset of the visible faces if it's placed on the far triangle of the plane.  I converted the demo to run in r31 and it's the same thing.  I tried to debug it and it seems the render list sort order is based on the surfaces' centroidScreen.z.  Rotating and tilting the plane so its triangle centroid.z becomes bigger/smaller than the cube's centriod.z makes the cube appear/disappear, so I'm thinking my guess may be right.  (I'm just reading up on rendering since I haven't studied much CG, so please correct me if I'm wrong).  I'm guessing if this is the correct analysis, you probably know of the problem already.  Seems like you're doing the painter's algorithm.  Is doing pixel by pixel z-buffering too expensive?  If so, do you know of ways around the problem using the same algorithm?\n",

First render the plane/floor, then render the stuff on top. Something like this...\n\n```\nrenderer.autoClear = false;\n\nfunction loop() {\n\n    renderer.clear();\n    renderer.render( sceneFloor, camera );\n    renderer.render( scene, camera );\n\n}\n```\n"

Thus, once all elements are created, I would say that there is no pushing of elements to the GPU anymore, but only telling how they have changed (right?). \n\nStill though, when I draw 10.000 cubes on the screen once, and do not change the objectmatrix in any way, I only get < 1 fps with webGL. How come? \n\nI would argue (with my limited knowledge) that after the first push to the GPU, the rendering would speed up greatly, as the objects don't have to be changed after that point. One could simply tell the GPU: draw your buffers onto the screen, et voila! Or does it not work like that?\n",
