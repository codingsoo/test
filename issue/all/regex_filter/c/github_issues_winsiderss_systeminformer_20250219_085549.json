        "body": "I've been using ProcessHacker for over 5-6 years now and hate working on computers without it.  That includes work computers.  \r\n\r\nOver the years across different jobs, it's always been a battle to install it, and once it's installed, people make comments about its trustworthiness - all stemming from having Hacker in the name.\r\n\r\nAt the 1st company in 2016 it took me >6 months to get approval and that was only because a unique problem that I knew ProcessHacker could help with (paths of loaded dlls & open handles). I was finally able to convince my boss after remoting into my home PC and giving a demo.  \r\n  \r\nMy current employer is much more lax and programs don't require approval, however the security software _(I think Norton, I haven't been on the office PC since COVID and can't recall)_ put up a fight and denied access to even the ProcessHacker homepage. Attempts to download the installer from sourceforge were also blocked (would immediately get deleted), and USB storage devices are disabled on company PCs. \r\nEventually I circumvented these obstacles by remoting to my home PC via TeamViewer, 7-Ziping and encrypting the installer, dragging the archive to the desktop, then extracting the archived installer to a folder with permissions set so only I could read and write to it.  Apparently the security software doesn't scan in memory processes because that worked.     \r\nThanks to ProcessHackers auto-updater I haven't needed to jump through hoops since, and good thing because I can't do it a second time.  Not long after getting the office PC setup, my private free-for-personal-use-only TeamViewer account got banned for suspected corporate use (_after using it to configure my work PC like my home PC and print documents at work stored on my home PC_) due to connecting from a known corporate IP address...  \r\n\r\nSome of my fellow co-workers have commented on it, especially in regards to the name.  A few of them have also realized the utility and installed it on their own PC's (via encrypted 7z archive sent over Slack).\r\n\r\nSomething needs to be done to make ProcessHacker appear more trustworthy in the eyes  of the average person.     \r\nIMO, a name change to something more friendly without a negative connotation in regards to security would be hugely beneficial. \r\n\r\n\r\n----------------------\r\n\r\nIt's been a while since an official release. Perhaps when ProcessHacker V3 is ready to hit production, instead of calling it ProcessHacker V3,  it could be the all new ProcessManager/ProcessBoss/ProcessCop/ProcessPatrol/ProcessInspector/ProcessInvestigator/ProcessInterrogator v1.0"

But unfortunately the source of this problem (as usually with other problems in the world) corporate culture. Notice how none of the corporate targeted software tools contain \"Hack\" or \"Crack\" or any 1337 scene stuff in their name, because it raises suspicion for all the wrong reasons. Corporate shit needs to be non-threatening, sterile, radio-friendly, unimaginative and should not invoke any emotion other than optionally awe and/or optimism. It's horrible, I despise that, but unfortunately they will ban anything which goes against those.\r\n\r\nBecause of these shenanigans ProcessHacker with its name is only useful on personal PC's which the user has full control over, but painfully it can't be used in many professional or academic environments, and again because our prejudicial society is broken, this amazing tool cannot reach its full potential and reputation it can possibly have. Unfortunately for a rightfully paranoiac IT security person or sysadmin who don't know this tool and doesn't have time to look into this tool, the name might unjustly automatically suggest malicious intent. :("

Those certificates are hundreds of dollars and a huge hassle all around.\r\n\r\nThe alternative, which is getting unsigned executables past IT and AV is not much easier, if not harder than getting something through with \"hacker\" in its name. AV software and Windows in general is extremely allergic to unsigned code, to the point that it complains about running programs _you compiled yourself in Visual Studio..._"
