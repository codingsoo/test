A user can resize the sidebar up and down to a particular boundary (i.e. set Min and Max width).\r\n2. A user can entirely hide (and then show) the sidebar\r\n\r\nI use Grid with three columns: one for the sidebar, the second for the GridSplitter to accomplish resize and the third for the main content.\r\n\r\nIf I configure the Grid like this:\r\n\r\n```XAML\r\n<Grid.ColumnDefinitions>\r\n    <ColumnDefinition Width=\"Auto\" />\r\n    <ColumnDefinition Width=\"Auto\" />\r\n    <ColumnDefinition Width=\"*\" />\r\n</Grid.ColumnDefinitions>\r\n```\r\n\r\nI can successfully resize the sidebar and hide it with `IsVisible=\"True\"` but it does not have Min Width. If I set MinWidth for the sidebar control\r\n```XAML\r\n<Panel Grid.Column=\"0\" MinWidth=\"100\" />\r\n```\r\nI can still resize the leftmost column to the size less than it's content MinWidth. \r\n\r\nIf I set MinWidth for a Grid Column:\r\n```XAML\r\n<ColumnDefinition Width=\"Auto\" MinWidth=\"100\" />\r\n```\r\nThe splitter lets me resize the column down to this MinWidth (just like I need), however, when I hide the sidebar with `IsVisible=\"False\"` the column persists (i.e. blank space with MinWidth is shown).\r\n\r\nThe splitter is very thin and it is not an option to resize the column to width 0 and consider this as \"collapsed\" since there is no way to resize it back.\r\n\r\nI'm using Avalonia 0.10.0-rc1\r\n",

You mean the type name is assigned to `SelectedModule`? `SelectedModule` is a `string` so Avalonia is having to somehow convert `SubCommandModel` to a string, for which it uses `ToString()`. If you've not overridden `ToString`, then it will just return the name of the type, which is what you're seeing.\r\n\r\nAre you porting WPF code which uses `DisplayMemberName`? As you've seen we don't have this property in Avalonia, so a direct port isn't going to be possible. Or are you writing new code?\r\n\r\nCan you not just change `public string SelectedModule` to `public SubCommandModel SelectedModule` in your view model?"

This was born from the existence of user permissions in the software I help develop; it was easier in the long term to turn it into a standard for commands rather than create individual properties for visibility bindings. It's a big bother to get it right from outside of the framework, though, _especially_ with MenuItems.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I'm just wondering if there's any interest in such a concept from Avalonia devs + users. If so, I can champion a pull request. If not, I won't 🙂",

I think Avalonia uses implicit command definitions, but the same concept would apply.\r\n\r\nHere is a snippet to illustrate:\r\n```\r\npublic void DeleteItem(object parameter) {\r\n    foreach (var item in (IEnumerable<Item>)parameter)\r\n        _repo.DeleteItem(item);\r\n}\r\npublic bool CanDeleteItem(object parameter) {\r\n    return (parameter as IEnumerable<Item>)?.Count > 0 ?? false;\r\n}\r\npublic bool MayDeleteItem() {\r\n    return _permissionManager.HasDeleteItemPermission();\r\n}\r\n```"

This can be done pretty easily using styles in Avalonia, e.g. `<Style Selector=\"Button.autohide:disabled><Setter Property=\"IsVisible\" Value=\"False\"/></Style>`\r\n- If I want a three-state visible/disabled/hidden button, then I can set the command to null in the view model, and bound the `IsVisible` property to make the button only visible when the command is non-null, e.g. `<Button IsVisible=\"{Binding !!MyCommand}>`.\r\n\r\nDo the techniques above not address your use-cases?\r\n\r\nI wouldn't be adverse to adding e.g. a `ICommandEx` interface with a `ShouldShow` property on it (which is what I think you're suggesting, but with different naming), but I'd have a few reservations:\r\n\r\n- I usually use ReactiveUI's `ReactiveCommand` rather than rolling my own `ICommand` implementation. This wouldn't know anything about this new interface, meaning I'd have to roll my own `ICommand` implementation. That would probably mean that I personally wouldn't really use it.\r\n- Your description of the problem sounds very focused on your business logic. Does it really need to be part of the framework? Remember that once you add a feature, even if it's used by a _tiny_ minority, it's very hard to take it away without making people angry!\r\n- What other state could/should be put into this new interface? For example I often want to change the caption on the button depending on logic in the view model. Should we but a `Caption` property on this new interface? If so where do we stop? What is the boundary between framework and business logic?\r\n\r\nThere's also of course naming: `MayExecute` vs `CanExecute` isn't really very descriptive, which is why I suggested `ShouldSHow` but we can bikeshed that when we decide it's needed ;)"

Given the first two of the three bullet points underneath, it could be totally sufficient; it also looks more idiomatic.\r\n\r\nBTW, I happen to think `May` vs `Can` is perfectly descriptive.

Since the build targets for master branch are either net461 or netstandard2.0 then the minimum MacOS version this runs on would be 10.12? Anything lower does not support .Net Core SDK so netstandard2.0 is a no go and mono has only net 4.5 so net461 also cannot be satisfied. Am I getting this right? Or are there options to use Avalonia on older MacOS versions (I am interrested un versions starting 10.9)?",

There's really no reason to target the `ContentPresenter` specifically since its `Background` has a `TemplateBinding`, which is (probably) why my `:pointerover` selector works fine. Or am I mistaken about how `TemplateBinding` works?"

    "body": "Since we need to run user's code anyway (for custom controls, design-time mock data, etc), previewer will stay out of process. The main issue with the current one is that it's not portable and causes issues with build in visual studio.\r\n\r\nPortability issues come from the fact that previewer uses  some kind of reflection and win32 api voodoo to do the following:\r\n1) Load every assembly from build output directory\r\n2) Initialize it with \"proper\" windowing subsystem\r\n3) Initialize subsystem-specific hacks\r\n4) Pass created window handle to parent process via stdout, so it could be reparented via Win32 API.\r\n\r\nThat obviously won't work properly with .NET Core and other platforms. It also all happens in a separate executable file, which has to be shipped with VS Extension.\r\n\r\n\r\n----------------------\r\n\r\n\r\nSo, the new previewer implementation should live in Avalonia itself.\r\nIt would be initialized using appbuilder, something like:\r\n\r\n\r\n```cs\r\nAppBuilder.Configure<App>()\r\n    .UseRemotePreviewer() // <-------\r\n    .UsePlatformDetect()\r\n    .Start<MainWindow>();\r\n```\r\n\r\n`UseRemotePreviewer` should analyze environment variables and/or command line arguments to see if it's being run by some kind of IDE. In this case it should attempt to connect to IDE host using provided method.\r\nCommand line will look somewhat like:\r\n`--avalonia-start-previewer --avalonia-previewer-transport=tcp://127.0.0.1:15543`\r\n\r\nOnce connection is established, it will start sending log messages to the host.\r\n\r\nIt will next setup an offscreen windowing platform emulation and configure compatible rendering engine (for now Skia, since it already can render directly to a byte array), then *bypass further AppBuilder configuration options completely* and straight up call `SetupWithoutStarting`, followed by entering host's command handling mode.\r\n\r\nCommunication should be done using BSON messages. Host will send XAML updates, input events, scaling options changes and receive back framebuffer updates.\r\n\r\nThat makes previewer completely platform-agnostic, since you can just run compiled application with some command line options.\r\n\r\n----------------------\r\n\r\nBase support for remote widgets is worth of having a support that's completely separate from designer, since it potentially provides a lot of value by itself. For example, we could run our devtools directly on Android/iOS and then connect to them via TCP.\r\n\r\nDTO (data transfer objects) and Stream-based  for remote widget communications shall live in a separate library `Avalonia.Remote.Protocol` available via NuGet (might be worth including previewer-specific messages in the same library). It will be considered to be a protocol spec, since it directly maps to JSON objects. Each DTO should have a GUID. It should be possible to pass custom messages or substitute transport completely, because it may be required for end-user's application. \r\n\r\nWidget hosting and offscreen platform implementations should live in the main repo/library, since they are coupled to platform interfaces.\r\n\r\nWe should also provide Avalonia and WPF controls for rendering remote widgets, so it would be easy to use from VS extension and AvalonStudio.",
