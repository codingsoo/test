For example,\r\n`private const int TOKEN_NONE = 0;` does not have an offset, while\r\n`protected static int lastErrorIndex; // 0x0` does.\r\nThis probably isn't Il2cppDumper's fault, but I'm curious about it. It's also a little annoying because I believe const fields can still be modified in memory.\r\n\r\n- Upload executable file and global-metadata.dat: The example was from Pixel Gun 3D 16.6.1, but it should occur on all games. I could not upload executable and metadata because the file size is too big.",

I have used this tool successfully against a game that I want to analyse (and maybe mod later down the track...) and got a dump of the DummyDLLs which I thought included the code from the game, however they are just empty shells (as the name suggests, dummies).\r\n\r\nCan UTinyRipper use the DummyDLLs to \"reconstruct\"/dump the scripts in the game with code, or would it just restore the MonoBehaviours as empty shells? I suppose it's probably hard to interpret the C++ that the IL2CPP part of Unity creates into usable scripts, so you can kinda get a glimpse of the game's code structure but other than that, you don't have the full source code so-to-speak.\r\n\r\nCheers!",

But there have been some changes in the way generic functions are exported.\r\n\r\nFor example, in the current v6.2.1 release the script.json file has:\r\n    {\r\n      \"Address\": 41838464,\r\n      \"Name\": \"Method$Client.App.SingleInstance<AppModel>.get_Instance()\",\r\n      \"MethodAddress\": 21284416\r\n    },\r\n\r\nWhile the master branch has this:\r\n    {\r\n      \"Address\": 41838464,\r\n      \"Name\": \"Method$Client.App.SingleInstance<AppModel>.get_Instance()\",\r\n      \"MethodAddress\": 0\r\n    },\r\n\r\nIt can't seem to find the MethodAddress in this case. But with some \"Method$\" it still finds the address. The difference was in where it was used. The foreach (var i in metadata.metadataUsageDic[3]) loop is fine (all methodDef's have a methodIndex). But the foreach (var i in metadata.metadataUsageDic[6]) is different, none of the methodDef's have a methodIndex (all -1). \r\n\r\nThis also causes some functions to be missing (probably functions that aren't found due to the above).",
