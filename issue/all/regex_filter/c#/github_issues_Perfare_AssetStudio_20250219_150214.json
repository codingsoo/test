    "body": "I'm fairly new to all of this, but I do program for a living. I'm playing through a, uh, _foxy_ new game released this week and wished to export the manual pages from within the game to give myself a nice version of them for translation efforts, printing, etc.\r\n\r\nI've installed it via Game Pass/the Xbox app, which means it's thrown in with all the rest of the app store binaries under `C:\\Program Files\\WindowsApps\\`. This directory is typically unreadable by most users, so after working up the guts from reading enough tutorials to make me think it safe, I changed that entire directory's owner to the _Administrators_ group. Since I'm an admin, I can now browse it (in e.g. Windows Explorer) fine, even without _Run as Administrator_.\r\n\r\nHowever, attempting to _Load Folder_ from Asset Studio (I downloaded the `net5` variant) results in the following error:\r\n\r\n```\r\n************** Exception Text **************\r\nSystem.UnauthorizedAccessException: Access to the path 'C:\\Program Files\\WindowsApps\\Finji.TUNIC_1.0.8.0_x64__tys0ffscxatjj\\Secret Legend.exe' is denied.\r\n   at System.IO.FileStream.ValidateFileHandle(SafeFileHandle fileHandle)\r\n   at System.IO.FileStream.CreateFileOpenHandle(FileMode mode, FileShare share, FileOptions options)\r\n   at System.IO.FileStream..ctor(String path, FileMode mode, FileAccess access, FileShare share, Int32 bufferSize, FileOptions options)\r\n   at AssetStudio.AssetsManager.Load(String[] files) in C:\\projects\\assetstudio\\AssetStudio\\AssetsManager.cs:line 51\r\n   at AssetStudio.AssetsManager.LoadFolder(String path) in C:\\projects\\assetstudio\\AssetStudio\\AssetsManager.cs:line 36\r\n   at AssetStudioGUI.AssetStudioGUIForm.<>c__DisplayClass52_0.<loadFolder_Click>b__0() in C:\\projects\\assetstudio\\AssetStudioGUI\\AssetStudioGUIForm.cs:line 163\r\n   at System.Threading.Tasks.Task.InnerInvoke()\r\n   at System.Threading.Tasks.Task.<>c.<.cctor>b__277_0(Object obj)\r\n   at System.Threading.ExecutionContext.RunFromThreadPoolDispatchLoop(Thread threadPoolThread, ExecutionContext executionContext, ContextCallback callback, Object state)\r\n--- End of stack trace from previous location ---\r\n   at System.Threading.ExecutionContext.RunFromThreadPoolDispatchLoop(Thread threadPoolThread, ExecutionContext executionContext, ContextCallback callback, Object state)\r\n   at System.Threading.Tasks.Task.ExecuteWithThreadLocal(Task& currentTaskSlot, Thread threadPoolThread)\r\n--- End of stack trace from previous location ---\r\n   at AssetStudioGUI.AssetStudioGUIForm.loadFolder_Click(Object sender, EventArgs e) in C:\\projects\\assetstudio\\AssetStudioGUI\\AssetStudioGUIForm.cs:line 163\r\n   at System.Threading.Tasks.Task.<>c.<ThrowAsync>b__140_0(Object state)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe program does this whether or not I launch it with _Run As Administrator_. The program seems to be able to open other files in that same directory tree just fine, but the `exe` itself is a problem. Its owner and group don't seem problematic, and I can launch and play the game myself just fine.\r\n\r\nIs this expected, or am I doing something wrong?",

The root issue seems to be that these objects have a \"valueGuidInternal\" field of type byte[]. The dumper attempts to read this array by re-aligning the stream after each byte, but all the array elements are packed in the asset file with no padding between them.\r\n\r\nI am unsure if the packing behavior is specific to these wwise types or would be the case for all arrays of byte (or boolean?). I have made a local change that skips alignment after reading a primitive type if the type is an array element, instead re-aligning after processing the whole array. This seems to work for Phoenix Point but I don't know if it will break other games.",

I think it would be nice to allow the option of recreating the directory structure using a specfied folder as root, with the assets exported at this point in the subdirectory having the name of the container.\r\n \r\nE.g. CAB-1234 contains the Mesh B-LOD0 and the Texture2D B_alb as part of a container having the internal name and path assets/main/content/models/B.asset, the option would allow to specify a path, create the path /assets/main/content/models/B.asset directory, and then would export B-LOD0 and B_alb in said directory.",
