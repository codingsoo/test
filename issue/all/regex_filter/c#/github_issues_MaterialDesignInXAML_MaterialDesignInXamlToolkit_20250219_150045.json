This will typically be done with `PaletteHelper.GetTheme()` or the `GetTheme()` extension method on `ResourceDictionary`. Once you have that theme instance you can switch between Light/Dark themes simply by calling `SetDarkTheme()`/`SetLightTheme()` directly on it, which will update the internal brushes with the corresponding values. Finally, to apply the theme, you will need to call `PaletteHelper.SetTheme(Theme)` or more generically the `SetTheme()` extension method on `ResourceDictionary`.\r\n\r\n"

Many of those converters don't do much (or any error checking of their parameters), lack documentation, and highly specific to a given templates implements.

This is why many of the converters that are intended to simply support that template are marked as internal. I am not opposed to making more of the converters public, though ones like `TextFieldClearButtonVisibilityConverter` would need to be updated to handle error cases; and ideally unit tests."

    "body": "Hi, this is more of a question then issue.\r\n\r\nAre you going to add Keys to all the styles and templates?\r\n\r\nIt's really irritating that i have to create styles for every control and everything because your templates and styles override the default looks and behaviours.  I mean, I love your controls and all of it, but sometimes i have some of my styles, some of them just slightly alter the default versions of items, and somewhere i really just use the default items. But now i have to rewrite styles of each control due to overlapping.\r\n\r\nIs it possible to evade that somehow  ? \r\n\r\nP.S. where can i see a roadmap or something like that? When do we expect 4.0.0? ",

Those resource dictionaries should not have any implicit styles so you should be able to reference the ones that you want without getting any implicit styles. \r\n\r\nThe other thing to note is that technically all of the styles do have keys set on them. The implicit styles (the ones with just a TargetType, and no explicit x:Key), can be reference in your BasedOn by using the type. For example if you want to extend the default button style you can do something like this:\r\n\r\n```XAML\r\n<Style TargetType=\"Button\" BasedOn=\"{StaticResource {x:Type Button}}\">\r\n...\r\n</Style>\r\n```"

I may be mistaken but besides your toolkit all icons have to be imported via another package/toolkit and that’s just the icons. It seems to me Material Visual is pretty bare bones but mostly can provide the basics, cross platform on mobile, in a consistent manner. Just a suggestion you pursue mobile support because I’m really admiring this toolkit. If you happen to change your minds I think there would be a lot of interest and in that case I’d love to be updated. Regardless, cheers and thanks for the reply. :)"

After the implementation of the code abovetThe FontSize changed to the Value I set, but the Column Headers hadn't the Material Design font anymore and so on...it changed to the standard C# WPF Style, which I don't want as well.\r\n\r\nSo now I ask you guys, if there is an easy way to change the FontSize of DataGrid Column Headers?\r\nThanks for every help.",

Language will control the time format specifier (usually `:`) and the AM/PM designators (in some culture this will simply be an empty string). The `SelectedTimeFormat` will indicate if it should be a short or long time format (typically whether you want to see a leading 0 or not). The `Is24Hours` will force it to use a 24 hour clock. The `WithSeconds` will determine if it displays seconds as well.\r\n\r\nLet me know if this does not resolve your request.  "

My expected behaviour is: When I place mouse over a `PART_Toggle`, popup is opened, but clicking on this button instead of closing popup executes my command. So, I copied the `MaterialDesignMultiFloatingActionPopupBox` style to my project and changed the line:\n\n```\n<ToggleButton x:Name=\"PART_Toggle\" Style=\"{StaticResource ToggleButtonStyle}\" \n IsChecked=\"{Binding RelativeSource={RelativeSource TemplatedParent}, Path=IsPopupOpen, Mode=TwoWay}\"...\n```\n\nto\n\n```\n<ToggleButton x:Name=\"PART_Toggle\" Style=\"{StaticResource ToggleButtonStyle}\"\n Command=\"{Binding MyPrimaryCommand}\"... \n```\n\nbut now, `MyPrimaryCommand` is executed only on second click on the ToggleButton and first click still closes the popup. It is possible to handle also first click without making changes in the `PopupBox` class?\n",
