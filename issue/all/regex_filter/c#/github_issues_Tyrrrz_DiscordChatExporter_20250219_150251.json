Much like a multilayered image were there's the conversation layer and the image, or gif active on loop, or a embed video in it that can be manually changed thought a link embed by the user. of course that'd make another turbulent and excruciating brainstorm and coding for you guys but while making something why not make it awesome you know?\r\n\r\nCause it would be pretty pointless to go through all the work to make a general plain tasteless straight export text kind of thing",

    "body": "So... the problem I've had with Discord, and what I was hoping this would solve, is that I don't seem to have an easy, automatic way to export or copy and paste chat logs from Discord to other applications--such as Google Docs or Kanka.io--and be able to preserve both the white space _and_ basic formatting options like _italics_ or **bold**. Every method I've tried, I've had to manually fix one or the other, and for the community I'm trying to manage, this is far too much work to do manually. Unfortunately, this exporter does not end up solving that problem for me.\r\n\r\nPlaying around with it, I found that the big issue comes down to the html exporter using a sort of \"preserve whitespace\" style to, well, preserve whitespace, and the programs I'm trying to copy into want to drop that like it's hot. Even tried a quick find/replace to get rid of the \"class\" attribute that ended up orphaned when the style got dropped, and replacing it with a \"style\" right on the tag itself to replicate the effect. Nope, programs dropped that too. Also, there isn't a good way to just find-replace all the line breaks with html tags automatically, because it creates _way_ too many new lines with the formatting.\r\n\r\nWith that in mind, I tried other options. HTML seems like it's the only one that's going to preserve the italics / bold type formatting, but I did notice that the .json programatically replaces newlines with a /n, so it seems like, potentially, most of the work for what I'm looking for is already done.\r\n\r\nWould it be possible to create an option for, or a version of, the html exporters that takes a more active role in handling whitespace? Because if so it would _really_ help me out with what I'm trying to do. :)",

That won't work with, for example, preformatted code blocks, which is why the preserve whitespace is used (and also why it's used in the Discord app itself). HTML is not meant for consumption by other programs, so sounds like either you're using the wrong tool for the job and should be using JSON, or the problem is with the programs you're using not being able to handle whitespace correctly."

How can I get the name of the mentioned role by having its ID.\r\nOnce again, this is not an issue with your application and I once again apologize for having to post this here.\r\nI just couldn't find anywhere else an answer to my problem, (as far as I know, after reading Discord's developer portal docs, they do not explain it anywhere).\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nVilian",

That is, by not substituting custom emote names (`<:name:id>`), channels (`<#id>`), mentions (`<@id>`) and so on. As it is now, the contents are converted to a human-readable format, but especially for JSON and CSV formats, it might be desirable to have the option to store the messages as they are actually sent. Discord markup is a subset of this that is exported raw in the text formats but parsed for HTML, so there is certainly a precedent for this. And it would increase the amount of information that could be gotten out of the exports.\r\nI am using the CLI, but AFAIK, the GUI doesn't have an option for this either. For the CLI, I imagine it could be implemented as another option switch.",

Plus, parsing these programmatically is just impossible anyway because these names could contain characters such as spaces as well, meaning you wouldn't be able to know where the name ended. And considering JSON is supposed to be parsed by a program anyway, I would expect it to behave in a program-friendly manner, retaining as much information as possible of the original message.\r\n\r\nThis last point is valid for all of them, really. In the JSON format (and all non-HTML ones, for that matter), how can I know if `:thonk:` is an emote or if someone just happened to type that text without it being an emote? How do I know, if I see `#general-chat`, whether the channel name is just `#general` and someone added `-chat` after it (not being part of the link, that is)?\r\n\r\nBasically, as a technical Discord user myself, I am looking for a way to get the raw, plain text data of messages, for a multitude of reasons, which are certainly not limited to the ones listed above. I'd like to archive *all* the data, not just the data a normal user may find of importance.\r\n\r\nYour title change to \"without markdown parsing\" seems to be a misunderstanding as well. I said that markdown parsing _is_ already disabled when exporting to non-HTML formats. I was talking about how some other, non-formatting things, are still parsed. I guess it depends on how broadly you take your definition of markdown."

tested it using the html format with v2.27.1 and v2.29.\r\n\r\nAlso for some reason it's not doing the default --parallel 1, it's doing like 2 or 3 channels or something at a time.\r\n\r\nSystem: Devuan Beowulf (basically Debian Buster without systemd)\r\n.net: dotnet-runtime-3.1 (from microsoft repo)\r\nCommand: dotnet DiscordChatExporter.Cli.dll exportguild -f HtmlLight --dateformat \"yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.ffff (UTCK)\" -t \"bot token\" -b -g serverID -o \"path/%G > %P %T > %p %C [%c].html\"\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n- Pick a server with many channels (like over 220).\r\n- Use dotnet runtime 3.1 with the same CLI command I used.\r\n- You get a big error every time and it doesn't obey the default number of parellel connections.\r\n- Presumably not all of these steps are needed.
