You can directly map ProductCreateDto to ProductDto and then insert a new translation record using ProductCreateDto's Name field and current language.\r\n\r\n2. Using a mapping is not a good idea here I guess. You can check Product.Translations array for the updated language and insert/update appropriate record in your app service method."

It uses angular CLI which is greate, when I use generate commands to create components and other elements those are added automatically to project which is even better. My question is how is this happening? How did you set this up? I couldn't find information how to achieve this kind of setup. \r\nMassive thank you for amazing work on Abp!",

Please advise how to handle it?\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic async Task CreateVendor(CreateVendorInput input)\r\n        {\r\n            try\r\n            {\r\n                using (var uow = UnitOfWorkManager.Begin(System.Transactions.TransactionScopeOption.RequiresNew))\r\n                {\r\n                    var vendor = ObjectMapper.Map<Vendor>(input);\r\n                    await _vendorRepository.InsertAsync(vendor);\r\n                    uow.Complete();\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n            catch (Exception ex)\r\n            {\r\n                throw ex.InnerException;\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n",

So code above works like I expected (Entites from modules are loaded).\r\n\r\nNow when I use tooling for add migration using console and execute command: dotnet ef migrations add TEST . Migration tool generate empty migration ! This is not correct behavior, maybe bug ..\r\n\r\nSo I enable automatick migration and try generate migration using this code in EntityFramework module initializer:\r\n\r\n```\r\nPreInitializeMethod:\r\n\r\n            var migrator = new System.Data.Entity.Migrations.DbMigrator(new Migrations.Configuration());\r\n            migrator.Update();\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nAutomatic migration is created and database is updated like I expected.\r\nPlease do anybody has similiar problem ? I want to generate normal file migrations, maybe bug in tooling ?\r\n\r\nThanks for any help!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

I noticed the webapi project generated is a class library one (not an asp.net project).\n\nI needed to create a second webapi project with it's own controllers (not dynamic ones) and also using OWIN.\n\nI've created the module, updated the Owin Startup class according to #872.\n\nHowever I don't get an \"EnsureInitialized\" error (as the aforementioned question). I'm getting this:\n\n**An error occurred when trying to create a controller of type 'TestController'. Make sure that the controller has a parameterless public constructor.**\n\nSo, what am I missing to enable dependency injection on my project?\n\nMy module is defined like this:\n\n```\n    [DependsOn(typeof(AbpWebApiModule), typeof(MyAppCoreModule))]\n    public class MyAppWebApiModule : AbpModule\n    {\n        public override void PreInitialize()\n        {\n            Configuration.BackgroundJobs.IsJobExecutionEnabled = false;\n            // Implementation here to get HttpConfig can be seen on #872\n            Configuration.Modules.AbpWebApi().HttpConfiguration = Startup.HttpConfig;\n        }\n\n        public override void Initialize()\n        {\n            IocManager.RegisterAssemblyByConvention(Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly());\n\n            // I don't want to have dynamic controllers to be added. So, I removed the line existing\n            // here on the original template calling DynamicController.Build();\n        }\n    }\n```\n\nI noticed that the module initialization (and pre-initialization) occurs before the Owin Startup actually runs. Could that be the problem?\n\nI also wanted to point out I'm using 0.8.3 version.\n\nI appreciate any help.\n",

When you are sending a notification, also send an email.\nYou can send emails via background job system (to retry on failure and not block the current request).\nSending email (or adding a background job) can be make in different places. For example, you can replace NotificationStore (by deriving from it) by your implementation and override InsertUserNotificationAsync method. Here, you can send email or add a background job for email.\nOr simpler, you can just send notification+email on notification sending code. Just create a wrapper and make it in a single method call.\n"

This way I could control the access to the api for an iOS app, an Android app, Windows app completely separately and prevent some third party from accessing the site data.\n\nSeparately I could apply user authorization to methods and controllers as some data provided to the apps would not require a user to be logged in. Take the Yelp.com app, you can download the Yelp iOS app, view restaurants and user reviews but cannot comment or write your own review until you have logged in.  I'm looking for a similar approach.

    "body": "Hi Halil,\n\nUsing a standard ABP MVC template I originally had the EF project as \n\nMakersLanePlatform.Infrastructure.EntityFramework\n\nI then renamed the prohect **and** amended the assembly name and namespace to (note missing Platform at the end):\n\nMakersLane.Infrastructure.EntityFramework\n\nApplication runs fine locally. However when I deploy the project I get the following in my Web.config (note Platform is back):\n\n``` xml\n <contexts>\n      <context type=\"MakersLanePlatform.EntityFramework.MlDbContext, MakersLanePlatform.Infrastructure.EntityFramework\">\n        <databaseInitializer type=\"System.Data.Entity.MigrateDatabaseToLatestVersion`2[[MakersLanePlatform.EntityFramework.MlDbContext, MakersLanePlatform.Infrastructure.EntityFramework], [MakersLanePlatform.Migrations.Configuration, MakersLanePlatform.Infrastructure.EntityFramework]], EntityFramework, PublicKeyToken=b77a5c561934e089\">\n          <parameters>\n            <parameter value=\"DefaultConnection_DatabasePublish\" />\n          </parameters>\n        </databaseInitializer>\n      </context>\n    </contexts>\n```\n\nI have nothing special in my Web.release.config transform:\n\n``` xml\n <connectionStrings>\n    <add name=\"DefaultConnection\" connectionString=\"server=xxxx;User Id=xxxx;password=xxxx;Persist Security Info=True;database=MakersLaneDB;MultipleActiveResultSets=True\" providerName=\"System.Data.SqlClient\"\n      xdt:Transform=\"SetAttributes\" xdt:Locator=\"Match(name)\"/>\n  </connectionStrings>\n```\n\nEven if I rename the contexts above to remove platform I still get:\n\n```\nSystem.TypeLoadException: Could not load type 'MakersLane.EntityFramework.MlDbContext' from assembly 'MakersLane.Infrastructure.EntityFramework'.\n\nGenerated: Tue, 28 Oct 2014 05:54:44 GMT\n\nSystem.InvalidOperationException: Failed to set database initializer of type 'System.Data.Entity.MigrateDatabaseToLatestVersion`2[[MakersLaneEntityFramework.MlDbContext, MakersLane.Infrastructure.EntityFramework], [MakersLane.Migrations.Configuration, MakersLane.Infrastructure.EntityFramework]], EntityFramework, PublicKeyToken=b77a5c561934e089' for DbContext type 'MakersLane.EntityFramework.MlDbContext, MakersLane.Infrastructure.EntityFramework' specified in the application configuration.

But your user will not be compatible with ABP's user assumption.\n\nSo, why this assumption exists? Because ABP provide session system (See IAbpSession, you can inject it and get current user's and tenant's id). This session system is used internally by ABP to get current user iand write audit fields (like CreatorUserId). Making User Id generic will require tihs class and all classes uses it will be generic. Also, there are  (and will be) some systems in ABP that will work with User's Id. Assumption of primary key makes to implement something possible, otherwise it  was impossible.\n\nSince ABP is proper for new applications, I thought that developers can fit into it. I advice to use long as User's Id as ABP assumes :)\n\nHave a nice day.\n"

Here is my repository method GetLocationMappings():\n\n``` c#\n    /// <summary>\n    ///     Base class for all application services for the application.

As soon as I try and create the new LocationMappingDto I get the exception. As this is all done in a single repository method I don't understand why the connection has been closed?\n",

        "body": "Hi,\n\nThis is about lazy load of EF. Alternative solutions:\n1. You can make GetLocationMappings method virtual, like:\n   <pre>public virtual GetLocationMappingsOutput GetLocationMappings(GetLocationMappingsInput aInput)</pre>\n   Thus, ABP can implement UOW for this method, and session will be usable in this method. If you did use this class over an interface, it was not needed.\n\nThis works but also implement 2nd solution:\n1. You can select LocationMappingTableModel included Countries. This is better than 1st solution (Actually, you should make it virtual anyway). Because, in first solution, EF will make a db query for each contry and this is a performance killer. This known as N+1 problem. When you Include Contries, it will execute just one query.\n   To implement it, You can add a method to your repository named GetAllListWithCountries() and in that like this:\n   <pre>return GetAll().Include(l => l.Country).ToList();</pre>\n\nIf you have added referenced to EntityFramework nuget package to your application layer and made GetLocationMappings virtual, then you can replace this line:\n\nList<LocationMappingTableModel> locationMappings = _LocationMappingRepository.GetAllList();\n\nwtih this one:\n\nList<LocationMappingTableModel> locationMappings = _LocationMappingRepository.GetAll().Include(l => l.Country).ToList();;\n\nThus, you don't need to create a new repository method.\n"

As you can see I did use the IRepository interface to call this method?\n\nI understand about using Include() to get the dependent entities. It was a mistake on my part that GetAllList() did that for included objects. Any chance you can add a call GetAllList(bool aWithInclude) where aWithInclude will do the necessary Include calls?\n\nI also appreciate your advice provided:\n- EmEntityCommon, EmEntityBase have been made abstract now. I was previously going to add some common functionality there but then decided against it and did not make them abstract agauin\n- Using TableModel as a suffix is an old habit. Changing to Entity would be better as I already have them descending from EmEntityBase\n- Yep understand about using AutoMapper for GetLocationMappings but as I was having issues with the Include() of Country I had taken it out for debugging.\n"

NHibernate does not support multiple include but EF supports it. If you will never change EF, than reference EF from application layer and use GetAll().Include(...).

I have a multi page site using EF. I'd like to cache certain costly sets of data, I'd usually use System.Web.Caching... to store expensive objects.\nWhat its the suggested approach with abp? I was thinking that a caching module may be an  option so that the code stays out of the mvc project, but it feels like it would be better positioned at the repo tier rather than web tier.\nI'd be really interested to hear your thoughts on the subject from both a best practice and abp point of view.\n\nThanks\n\nRick\n",

It does not restrict to use any caching approach.\n\nI think caching should be done using ORM framework's level 2 cache. NHibernate strongly supports it. Also EntityFramework has support (I did not try actually). If we only use ORM's built-in methods for data operations, Level2 caching is really good. But if we're manipulating database with custom SQL string queries, caches don't update. So, we must handle it.\n\nAlso, for special to ABP, we may cache application service return values using method or class level attributes. But we should think carefully on caching. It may come with many other problems. \n"

Any ideas?\n",

Probably there is an error in ASP.NET Web API level and AJAX call fails. Also, run project in debug mode, VS may break and find the exception line. Also, you can try to change CustomErrors = Off in web.config.\n\nNormally, it works as you expected and as working on samples. Please share result with me.\n"
