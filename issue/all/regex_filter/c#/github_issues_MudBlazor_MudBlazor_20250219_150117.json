Most consists of several components with their own css. So the css in MudBlazor is not just ’plug and play’ with other simpler css frameworks.\r\n\r\nThis is because good looking Material based components requires a slight more complex DOM compared to other frameworks. If youve seen other frameworks that offers both bootstrap and material ui - youve probably noticed that the material ui looks iffy - because they have the same DOM but only different CSS.\r\n\r\nYou can, of course, override the stylesheet used in MudBlazor (the individual classes) when needed (just like any stylesheet) but I guess its not what you were after."

I have set hover=true so the whole row is highlighted as expected but can't see how to set a click event. The workaround I am using at the moment is to add a MudLink to a cell but that means the user needs to move the mouse over the link rather just selecting the row and clicking anywhere inside.\r\n\r\nIf this is not currently possible I think it could be a good enhancement.\r\n\r\nThanks for your good work.\r\n\r\nLuis",

The button click handlers will need to know the selected portion of the text for further processing.\r\ne.g. I will select \"fox\" and tag it as an \"animal\" or select \"jumped over\" and tag it as  \"activity\". \r\n\r\nIf this is not possible with a single MudText, I can also have each word in a separate MudText however I want to be able to select more than one word. I can use any other component as well if that works.\r\n\r\nI don't necessarily need a text editor like the one I am using to write this issue.

Because of this we use a custom DateTime provider, which sets an arbitrary \"current\" date and time throughout the application. We use this for development, automated testing and presentations. We pretty much only use real time in production and for UAT. The whole project is implemented this way, except for date pickers. It's currently impossible to do this with the MudDatePicker, as it currently uses DateTime.Today to determine the current date.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nIt should be possible to inject a custom DateTime provider, that would allow users to set a different \"current\" date on the component.\n\n### Have you seen this feature anywhere else?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\n_No response_\n\n### Pull Request\n\n- [ ] I would like to do a Pull Request\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [X] I agree to follow this project's Code of Conduct",
