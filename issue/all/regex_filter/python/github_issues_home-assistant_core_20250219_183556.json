When asking for a log on a component you got three charts:\ndaily\nmonthly\nyearly\n\nI have a feeling domoticz had some continuous query (or something) running to produce the above values while keeping the database size down..The database I have now on HA has already grown 2mbs after 1 day of running (on my rpi)\nI had to remove the processor usage from HA to keep the database usable and small...\n\nMany thanks for this great product !\n",
