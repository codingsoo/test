It would be incredibly helpful if you could provide more detailed instructions, such as:\r\n\r\nTake these files.\r\nUpload them.\r\nChoose these entities (and explain why, as well as any alternative entities that can be extracted/used). ...\r\nAdditionally, I would like to upvote for the feature of reconstructing multiple documents with GraphRag. Imagine having a codebase with folders and files, and wanting to better understand which files do what and how they are inter-related. This seems like a great use case.\r\n\r\nThank you!\r\n",

    "body": "### Describe your problem\r\n\r\nI know that ragflow not include metadata yet.\r\nBut I have a recurring problem and I need a advise to fear it.\r\n\r\nI haver several documents with the same information but with corrections\r\n\r\nLaw 1 of 2013 with max allowed values about a component\r\nrevision of 2019 with other values\r\nrevision of 2023 with other values\r\n\r\nI want the latest values but LLLM doesn't know what chunk is \"most modern\" and he tell me that:\r\n\r\n```\r\na información sobre el margen de tolerancia aplicable a un abono con aminoácidos es inconsistente en la base de conocimiento proporcionada. Hay varias entradas con diferentes valores:\r\n\r\nEntrada 1: Indica un 15% del valor declarado del contenido en cualquier elemento nutriente principal, con un máximo en valor absoluto de: N total 0,9; N orgánico 0,4; P2O5 0,9; K2O 0,9. También menciona una tolerancia para el total de aminoácidos libres: 10% del valor declarado (máximo 1% en valor absoluto si el valor declarado es 10%, o 10% del valor declarado si es menor a 10%). Para cada aminoácido libre declarado en el aminograma, la tolerancia es del 25% del valor declarado .\r\n\r\nEntrada 2: Menciona un 20% del valor declarado del contenido en cualquier elemento nutriente principal, con un máximo en valor absoluto de: N total 1,1; P2O5 1,1; K2O 1,1. Para el total de aminoácidos libres, indica 10% del valor declarado con un máximo del 3% en valor absoluto si el valor declarado es 10%, o 10% del valor declarado si es menor a 10%. Para cada aminoácido libre declarado en el aminograma, la tolerancia es del 25% del valor declarado ##5 ##1.\r\n\r\nEntrada 3: Indica un 10% del valor declarado del contenido en cualquier elemento nutriente principal, con un máximo en valor absoluto de: N total 0,9; N orgánico y en otras formas 0,5; P2O5 0,9; K2O 0,9. Si contiene más de un nutriente principal, la tolerancia es del 15% del valor declarado, con máximos de 1,1 para N total, 0,5 para N orgánico, y 1,1 para P2O5 y K2O. Para el total de aminoácidos libres, indica 10% del valor declarado con un máximo del 3% en valor absoluto si el valor declarado es 10%, o 10% del valor declarado si es menor a 10%. Para cada aminoácido libre declarado en el aminograma, la tolerancia es del 25% del valor declarado.\r\n\r\nEs crucial determinar qué fuente es la correcta o si se debe aplicar una interpretación considerando las diferentes regulaciones o versiones. Sin más información, no es posible determinar con certeza cuál es el margen de tolerancia aplicable.\r\n```\r\n\r\nis a good answer, each entry is for one law. but he doesn't know what law is the each one. when I ask he tell me that he don't know. How can associate each chunks with their document? maybe with autowords manually?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

RAGFlow aim's to guarantee the eventual effectiveness of RAG, it's not an LLMOps platform, so we'll only integrate the ones that deserve to be integrated, not the ones that are likely to be used"

Even as I manually added images (uploaded them) to files and linked them to the knowledge base, the chat still didn't recognize that. (It will also makes more sense to be able to automate bulk action to link uploaded files to knowledge base rather than one by one.\r\n\r\nAnd it will be more powerful to have the tables in the document also extracted as separate chunks.\r\n\r\nIs my impression right that when you increase response length in the setting that impact the response quality? And how to solve that if you are pulling the answer using api calls?",
