Therefore, I think the LangChain framework, a message-based service, would be more suitable with SCYLLA DB. I'm curious about the main contributors' opinions on switching the main DB to SCYLLA.\n\nThis database is written in C++ and is also used by Discord. Of course, like Discord, middleware construction seems necessary, and if you could provide a draft for this, our company would contribute as much as possible.",
