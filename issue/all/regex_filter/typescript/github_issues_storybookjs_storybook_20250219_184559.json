    "body": "### Describe the bug\n\nI upgraded our project from the latest version 7.x to 8 beta 1. One of the codemod from the migration tool detected that our project is a monorepo and changed our config file to add a `getAbsolutePath()` function and use it to wrap the list of addons in the config. This is our config after the migration:\r\n```ts\r\nimport type { StorybookConfig } from '@storybook/react-vite'\r\nimport { resolve } from 'node:path'\r\nimport { dirname, join } from 'path'\r\nimport { mergeConfig } from 'vite'\r\n\r\nconst config: StorybookConfig = {\r\n  stories: ['../stories/**/*.mdx', '../stories/**/*.stories.@(ts|tsx)'],\r\n  staticDirs: ['../public'],\r\n  core: {\r\n    disableTelemetry: true,\r\n  },\r\n  addons: [\r\n    getAbsolutePath('@storybook/addon-links'),\r\n    getAbsolutePath('@storybook/addon-essentials'),\r\n    getAbsolutePath('@storybook/addon-interactions'),\r\n    getAbsolutePath('@storybook/addon-a11y'),\r\n  ],\r\n  framework: {\r\n    name: getAbsolutePath('@storybook/react-vite'),\r\n    options: {},\r\n  },\r\n  docs: {\r\n    autodocs: true,\r\n  },\r\n  async viteFinal(config) {\r\n    return mergeConfig(config, {\r\n      resolve: {\r\n        alias: [\r\n          {\r\n            find: 'stories',\r\n            replacement: resolve(__dirname, '../stories'),\r\n          },\r\n        ],\r\n      },\r\n    })\r\n  },\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default config\r\n\r\nfunction getAbsolutePath(value: string): any {\r\n  return dirname(require.resolve(join(value, 'package.json')))\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen building Storybook, we now see this warning:\r\n> WARN Expected '@storybook/addon-actions' (or '@storybook/addon-essentials') to be listed before '@storybook/addon-interactions' in main Storybook config.\r\n\r\nExcept that `@storybook/addon-essentials` **is listed before** `@storybook/addon-interactions`.\n\n### To Reproduce\n\nUse the same config as above with Storybook 8 beta 1.\n\n### System\n\n```bash\nStorybook Environment Info:\r\n\r\n  System:\r\n    OS: Windows 10 10.0.19045\r\n    CPU: (12) x64 Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-9850H CPU @ 2.60GHz\r\n  Binaries:\r\n    Node: 20.8.1 - C:\\Program Files\\nodejs\\node.EXE\r\n    npm: 10.4.0 - C:\\Program Files\\nodejs\\npm.CMD <----- active\r\n  Browsers:\r\n    Chrome: 121.0.6167.160\r\n    Edge: Chromium (121.0.2277.83)\n```\n\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",

    "body": "**Describe the bug**\r\nWhen using both `@storybook/vue` v6+ and `@vue/cli-plugin-typescript` v4.4, typechecking is disabled\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behaviour:\r\n\r\n0. Start a brand new vue project with typescript using vue cli v4\r\n0. Introduce a type violation by replacing the `msg` prop in the default `HelloWorld.vue` component with:\r\n    ```js\r\n    {\r\n        type: String,\r\n        validator( value: string ): string {\r\n            return value.startsWith( 'Hello' );\r\n        },\r\n        default: 'Hello World',\r\n    }\r\n   ```\r\n0. Execute `npm run build`\r\n   **Note:** At this point checks should still fail.\r\n0. Ensure that in your `package.json`, the package `@vue/cli-plugin-typescript` is set to version `~4.4.0` (if not, change the version number and reinstall packages)\r\n0. Execute `npm run build`\r\n   **Note:** At this point checks should still fail.\r\n0. Install storybook v6: `npm i -D @storybook/vue`\r\n0. Execute `npm run build`\r\n   **Note:** At this point the build passes without type checking errors\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nType checking should produce errors on build, regardless of the version of storybook installed\r\n\r\n**Code Snippets**\r\n`package.json`\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"name\": \"bloopy\",\r\n  \"version\": \"0.1.0\",\r\n  \"private\": true,\r\n  \"scripts\": {\r\n    \"serve\": \"vue-cli-service serve\",\r\n    \"build\": \"vue-cli-service build\",\r\n    \"test:unit\": \"vue-cli-service test:unit\",\r\n    \"test:e2e\": \"vue-cli-service test:e2e\",\r\n    \"lint\": \"vue-cli-service lint\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"dependencies\": {\r\n    \"core-js\": \"^3.6.5\",\r\n    \"vue\": \"^2.6.11\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"devDependencies\": {\r\n    \"@storybook/vue\": \"^6.0.27\",\r\n    \"@types/jest\": \"^24.0.19\",\r\n    \"@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin\": \"^2.33.0\",\r\n    \"@typescript-eslint/parser\": \"^2.33.0\",\r\n    \"@vue/cli-plugin-babel\": \"~4.5.0\",\r\n    \"@vue/cli-plugin-e2e-nightwatch\": \"~4.5.0\",\r\n    \"@vue/cli-plugin-eslint\": \"~4.5.0\",\r\n    \"@vue/cli-plugin-typescript\": \"~4.4.0\",\r\n    \"@vue/cli-plugin-unit-jest\": \"~4.5.0\",\r\n    \"@vue/cli-service\": \"~4.5.0\",\r\n    \"@vue/eslint-config-typescript\": \"^5.0.2\",\r\n    \"@vue/test-utils\": \"^1.0.3\",\r\n    \"chromedriver\": \"86\",\r\n    \"eslint\": \"^6.7.2\",\r\n    \"eslint-plugin-vue\": \"^6.2.2\",\r\n    \"geckodriver\": \"^1.20.0\",\r\n    \"sass\": \"^1.26.5\",\r\n    \"sass-loader\": \"^8.0.2\",\r\n    \"typescript\": \"~3.9.3\",\r\n    \"vue-template-compiler\": \"^2.6.11\"\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n**System**\r\n```\r\nEnvironment Info:\r\n\r\n  System:\r\n    OS: Linux 5.4 Ubuntu 18.04.5 LTS (Bionic Beaver)\r\n    CPU: (8) x64 Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-8350U CPU @ 1.70GHz\r\n  Binaries:\r\n    Node: 10.19.0 - ~/.nvm/versions/node/v10.19.0/bin/node\r\n    npm: 6.14.4 - ~/.nvm/versions/node/v10.19.0/bin/npm\r\n  Browsers:\r\n    Chrome: 86.0.4240.111\r\n    Firefox: 81.0.2\r\n  npmPackages:\r\n    @storybook/vue: ^6.0.27 => 6.0.27 \r\n```\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\n**_This problem only occurs in conjunction with `@vue/cli-plugin-typescript` v4.4 and thus is RESOLVED when updating to v4.5_**.

None of my stories have had a problem with it.\r\n\r\nMy assumption is that it has something to do with how your story is defined, but nothing about that is in the description. There were some issues that caused stories to disappear in early versions of Storybook `6.0.0-rc-*`.\r\n\r\nI have noticed that Storybook seems to be either hiding some errors or ignoring some for an unclear reason, but I haven't narrowed down a consistent reproduction that shows a hidden problem that is clearly not my fault, yet.\r\n\r\nI use `CdkPortal` in multiple components with working stories. Some use it to just swap between a few components in a `cdkPortalOutlet`, some insert components into various `CdkOverlay`s, etc, so I don't think its the problem.\r\n\r\nDo you have any warnings in the devtools?\r\n\r\nI have had some stories not displaying, with the only indication that anything was wrong, is warnings logged in the devtools.\r\nThe warnings that caused my problem happened to be caused by the package `@ngneat/until-destroy`, and any story that used a component that used that package would not display the story in the sidebar. The most recent version of that package doesn't cause that problem any more. I think it had something to do with a difference in how Angular 10 defines the components and the JIT compiler couldn't handle it, but even though `ng serve` and `ng build` didn't error, it wasn't really a Storybook issue.\r\n\r\nSince the warning had nothing pointing to the story or component, I narrowed down my problem by modifying the `stories` glob in `.storybook/main.js` to only match the specific file with the story that didn't load. It was inconvenient, but that was how I realized the warnings were indicating my problem. Before doing that, I had been ignoring the warnings, assuming they were just from stories I hadn't updated yet."

Create a very simple story of a component with knobs + actions\r\n2. Trigger an action : An event is emitted one time (good)\r\n3. Modify multiple knobs values\r\n4. Trigger the same action : An event is emitted multiple times (bad)\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nTriggering an event should emit only once in the Actions tab.\r\n\r\n**System:**\r\n\"@angular/core\": \"~8.2.12\",\r\n\"@babel/core\": \"^7.6.4\",\r\n\"babel-loader\": \"^8.0.6\",\r\n\"@storybook/addon-a11y\": \"^5.3.0-beta.2\",\r\n\"@storybook/addon-actions\": \"^5.3.0-beta.2\",\r\n\"@storybook/addon-knobs\": \"^5.3.0-beta.2\",\r\n\"@storybook/addon-links\": \"^5.3.0-beta.2\",\r\n\"@storybook/addon-storysource\": \"^5.3.0-beta.2\",\r\n\"@storybook/addons\": \"^5.3.0-beta.2\",\r\n\"@storybook/angular\": \"^5.3.0-beta.2\",\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nOn the terminal :  \r\nAt Step 2, only one message \"storybook/actions/action-event\" is displayed.\r\nAt Step 4, several messages \"storybook/actions/action-event\" are displayed with unique ids.",

Notice the resolved value of the select is a _**string**_ NOT _**number**_\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nSelect could check the type of all the values provided and if all are `numbers` coerces/parse the value to a number type, like the way the `number` knob does.\r\n\r\nOr could have an optional param to say `isNumber` but that seems messy\r\n\r\n**Current Workaround**\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nexport const numberSelect = <T extends number>(\r\n  name: string,\r\n  options: { [s: string]: T },\r\n  value: T,\r\n  groupId?: string,\r\n): T => (parseInt(select<T | string>(name, options, value, groupId) as string) as T) || value;\r\n\r\nexport const myNumber = numberSelect<number>(\r\n  'number',\r\n  {\r\n    zero: 0,\r\n    one: 1,\r\n    two: 2,\r\n  },\r\n  0,\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\n**System:**\r\n```\r\nEnvironment Info:\r\n\r\n  System:\r\n    OS: macOS Mojave 10.14.6\r\n    CPU: (16) x64 Intel(R) Core(TM) i9-9980HK CPU @ 2.40GHz\r\n  Binaries:\r\n    Node: 10.15.2 - ~/.nvm/versions/node/v10.15.2/bin/node\r\n    Yarn: 1.16.0 - /usr/local/bin/yarn\r\n    npm: 6.9.0 - ~/../node_modules/.bin/npm\r\n  Browsers:\r\n    Chrome: 77.0.3865.90\r\n    Safari: 12.1.2\r\n  npmPackages:\r\n    @storybook/addon-actions: ^5.1.9 => 5.1.9\r\n    @storybook/addon-info: ^5.1.9 => 5.1.9\r\n    @storybook/addon-knobs: ^5.1.9 => 5.1.9\r\n    @storybook/react: ^5.1.9 => 5.1.9\r\n```\r\n",

There are data named as `data-reactroot` which when using Vue lead to believe you are using the wrong version.\r\n- The docs and site are about React 99%, even the Vue part is referencing at some point react instead of Vue.\r\n- FW specific addons should be moved to a different section.\r\n\r\nI am sure you are aware of this and working toward a transition, which takes time, but seems there are some easy task that could be done already. Like updating the repo description and docs.\r\n\r\nI can definitely help about this if required.",
