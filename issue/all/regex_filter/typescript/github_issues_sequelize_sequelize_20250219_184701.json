If you want to check that a value is not null before querying the DB, look at the validations section below.\r\n> \r\n> title: { type: Sequelize.STRING, allowNull: false },\r\n\r\nI never get this error.

    "body": "Apologies if this is not the place to raise this issue. \r\n\r\nI have an API written in NodeJS that communicates with a  MYSQL database. The API is running inside a Docker container. The database connection is handled via the Sequelize library.\r\n\r\nRecently, I have started seeing the following error intermittently on my API server logs:\r\n```\r\n{ Error: read ECONNRESET\r\n    at TCP.onread [as _originalOnread] (net.js:622:25)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAny subsequent query request from the API results in the following error:\r\n```\r\nSequelizeDatabaseError: Cannot enqueue Query after fatal error.\r\n```\r\n\r\nRecovery is only possible via a restart of the API. But the same issue sporadically re-appears, sometimes within an hour of a restart, sometimes almost immediately.\r\n\r\nI use the following connection pool configuration for my Sequelize instance:\r\n```\r\n  pool: {\r\n    max: 5,\r\n    min: 1,\r\n    evict: 300000,\r\n    idle: 10000\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nI gather that the ECONNRESET error is thrown when the other side of the TCP conversation abruptly closes its end of the connection.\r\n\r\n**I have the following questions:**\r\n\r\n1. Why does the sequelize connection continuously fail after an ECONNRESET? Is it correct to assume this is because the API server is attempting to re-use the failed TCP connection continuously for subsequent requests? Does this mean the library is unaware of the terminated connection?\r\n\r\n2. What could be the reasons for the connection to be terminated with an ECONNRESET error? I understand there could be a variety of reasons. Some general pointers here would be helpful.\r\n\r\n3. Is this something I should handle at a code level by adding a periodic heartbeat or something similar to ensure that my connection to the database is alive?\r\n\r\nAnd any other pointers on how I can proceed to debug this issue would be hugely appreciated!\r\n\r\nNode version: 8.12.0 (recently upgraded from 6.9.4)\r\nSequelize version: 3.30.2",

If it was to be implemented, _should_ it honor all parts of the active scope on those inclusions?\r\n\r\nTo me, it feels like honoring just the `order` may be a small and, I believe, non-breaking change that would not negatively impact existing users. However, honoring all parts of the active scope of inclusions would definitely be a breaking change, and, I would suspect, an unwelcomed one for established users.\r\n\r\nThoughts, @sushantdhiman?"

What it seems like is that the client releases the connection back to the pool between each query within a transaction - which means that the pool can be exhausted between two (or more - easiest to replicate with two) transactions both in the middle of their work waiting for a new connection that never arrives. \r\n\r\nIt seems weird that it'd release the connection back to the pool during an actual transaction - AFAIK that would result in a lot of weird behavior as well, but we're fairly certain we've managed to isolate it down to that. It doesn't seem to be dependent on any specific queries being run or anything - just about any query that results in a lock within the transaction and running some concurrent transactions will yield it. \r\n\r\n## What do you expect to happen?\r\nI expected each transaction to keep its already allocated connection for the lifetime of the transaction to ensure that the pool is not exhausted mid-transaction and mid-lock.\r\n\r\n## What is actually happening?\r\nThe system deadlocks with transactions waiting for each other on separate rows but with no connections to spare.\r\n\r\n_Output, either JSON or SQL_\r\n\r\n\r\n__Dialect:__ postgres\r\n__Dialect version:__ ?\r\n__Database version:__ 9.6.1\r\n__Sequelize version:__ 3.30.3\r\n__Tested with master branch:__ No, due to major syntax changes - if this is fixed in master, I'd be more than happy to rewrite our stuff if that's expected to fix this",

Seems so, but without clear docs and examples there's a lot of trial and error one must do if one is not the one who build it.... For now it seems that the only safe way to join tables is to work with `where` and not use the `on` key. Plus,  unlike SQL, `on` doesn't seem to be able to join arbitrary tables without defining association on them. No sure if this is a different issue/bug or if this is by design."

    "body": "Hi,\n\n  First off - sequelize has been a pleasure to work with.  Been helping much on a project I'm working on.  Digging around github, looks like LOTS of hard and mindful work has been put in.  Thanks. \n\n  I was wondering if it was possible to use a Model's instance method in the updating of a specific row.  The preference is to generate one update query (update... where...) and keep associated Model functionality, like creating a UUID, in the Model without replicating elsewhere.  So doing a find first, then an update would allow me to use instance methods (or getters/setters) on the Model, but would be an example of two queries.  I could also do an update() call with where clause, but would have to re-create the functionality in my model, like the generation of a UUID, and use that inside my update().  \n\nI'm using 2.0.0-rc8 with postgres.\n\nModel:\nI've simplified the Model here...\n\n``` javascript\nmodule.exports = function(sequelize, DataTypes) {\n  var tableA = sequelize.define(\"tableA\", {\n    id: {\n      type: DataTypes.UUID,\n      primaryKey: true,\n      defaultValue: DataTypes.UUIDV4,\n    }\n  }, {\n    classMethods: {\n      associate: function(models) {\n        tableA.belongsTo(models.tableB);\n      }\n    },\n    instanceMethods: {\n      newUUID: function() {\n        return uuid.v4();  // required sequelize's module dependency on node-uuid to enable this\n      }\n    }\n  });\n```\n\n  There are three ways I was trying to make this happen, and I'm probably just missing something...\n\n1.Using the update method:\n\n``` javascript\ntableA.update({\n      id: this.newUUID,\n    }, {\n      where: {\n        tableB_id: 'some value'\n      }\n    }\n  );\n```\n\nThe problem is that 'primaryKey' is considered null and this violate a not-null constraint - my understanding is that Model instance methods, and getters/setters require an instance to be created first, hence the issue.  I've observed this occurring with a field that is allowNull: false too.\n\n2.Building to generate an instance method:\n\n``` javascript\nvar tableUpdate = models.tableA.build({\n    id: this.newUUID,\n  }, {\n    isNewRecord: false  // to make this an update and NOT a create\n  });\n```\n\nThis works in providing me access to an instance method or a getter/setter, however I can't figure out how to limit the update to a \"where\" on a foreign key field.\n\n3.Creating a public function, outside sequelize, as a helper of sorts:\n\n``` javascript\nmodule.exports = function(sequelize, DataTypes) {\n  var tableA = sequelize.define(\"tableA\", {\n    id: {\n      type: DataTypes.UUID,\n      primaryKey: true,\n      defaultValue: DataTypes.UUIDV4,\n    }\n  }, {\n    classMethods: {\n      associate: function(models) {\n        tokenA.belongsTo(models.tableB);\n      }\n    }\n  });\n\n  tableA.newUUID = function() {\n    return uuid.v4();\n  }\n\n... then later on \n\n    tableA.update({\n      id: tableA.newUUID,\n    }, {\n      where: {\n        tableB_id: 'some value'\n      }\n    }\n  );\n```\n\nThis works, but its nature does not make it exclusive to a model's instance.  Maybe its good enough - it opens the door for a model helper file. \n\nIf it's not possible to do such a thing with one query, is it reasonable to request an options.where for a build? Or possibly some other solution?\n\nI may have overcomplicated things with my desire for one query vs two.  I'm open to any suggestions/best-practices.\n\nThanks.\n",

The biggest problem I've run into so far with Sequelize is the documentation. It's lengthy, but not terribly useful. It doesn't help that there is two different and inconsistent versions. The docs on sequelizejs.com are for 1.7.8 and still come up in google searches, while the ones on sequelize.readthedocs.org reference things that don't yet exist in 2.0.0rc3 (e.g. the docs reference the `belongsToMany` association, but that doesn't exist on 2.0.0rc3, it's still `hasMany`).\n"

If it has then it triggers some further database operations. In the after update hook it then generates a new css file based upon the state of the instance. During the process of generating the css file in the afterUpdate hook, it actually causes the instance to update again to stash the path of the generated css file. This then causes an infinite recursion because it goes through the beforeUpdate hook and cant detect the change we previously saved.\r\n\r\nSo you might say \"why not create the css file before?\". Well you cant rollback a css file upon error so was using the known validity of \"afterUpdate\" to indicate that the operation completed so therefore it is safe to generate a css file!\r\n\r\nPerhaps if there was was `instance.reset(attribute)` to reset the changed state of a particular attribute?"

The complete `findAll()` statement would be like:\n\n```\nmodels.Company.findAll({\n    where: {companyid: lis},\n    include: [{\n        model: models.Stock,\n        attributes: ['ticker'],\n        include: [{\n            model: models.Quote,\n            attributes: ['marketcap']\n        }]\n    }],\n    order: [\n        [models.Stock, models.Quote, 'createdAt', 'DESC']\n    ]\n})\n```\n\nTo order by the attributes of an include, you don't put the `order` attribute inside the include - it has to go at the root of the options. You specify an array which traces it's way through the includes.\n\nIn this case the `order` array is saying \"I want to sort by an attribute. To find that attribute, go into the included `Stock` model, then into the `Quote` model that's included from `Stock` and then the attribute is called `createdAt` and I want it sorted in `DESC` order.\n\nHard to explain... The reason ordering isn't specified inside the include clause itself is that if there are several order clauses at different levels of the include hierarchy, Sequelize would have no way of knowing which order to use first - i.e. no idea how to order the orders!\n\nAnyway, that'll get things in the right order for you. But how to limit it only the first result for each company, I do not know! I've never delved into that kind of thing as I've never needed it. I'm not even sure if it's possible in Sequelize without executing SQL directly using `query()`.\n\nEr... not sure if that's much help?\n"

The problem is that I need SubscriptionTier set up as a 'paranoid' table. If I 'destroy` a record in SubscriptionTier, it does not allow me to add another record with those values (Dup PK error). In this case, if a user subscribes to a tier then cancels it, they cannot re-subscribe in the future.

I realize composite keys with a null value isn't a best practice in MySQL, but seems like the cleanest in this case.\n\nSubscription > SubscriptionTier > Tier\n\n``` javascript\nvar Subscription = sequelize.define('Subscription', {\n        currentPrice: { type: DataTypes.INTEGER, allowNull: false },\n        currentTaxRate: { type: DataTypes.INTEGER, allowNull: false, defaultValue: 0 },\n        currentTotalPrice: { type: DataTypes.INTEGER, allowNull: false }\n    }, {\n        classMethods: {\n            associate: function(models){\n                Subscription.belongsTo(models.Tier, { as: 'CurrentTier', foreignKey: 'CurrentTierId'});\n                Subscription.hasMany(models.Tier, { through: models.SubscriptionTier });\n                //Other relationships omitted...\n            }\n        },\n        timestamps: true,\n        createdAt: 'start',\n        updatedAt: false,\n        deletedAt: 'end',\n        paranoid: true\n    });\n\nvar SubscriptionTier = sequelize.define('SubscriptionTier', {\n        price: { type: DataTypes.INTEGER, allowNull: false },\n        taxRate: DataTypes.INTEGER,\n        totalPrice: { type: DataTypes.INTEGER, allowNull: false }\n    }, {\n        classMethods: {\n            associate: function(models) {\n                SubscriptionTier.belongsTo(models.Tier);\n                SubscriptionTier.belongsTo(models.Subscription);\n                //Other relationships omitted...\n            }\n        },\n        timestamps: true,\n        createdAt: 'start',\n        updatedAt: false,\n        deletedAt: 'end',\n        paranoid: true\n    });\n\nvar Tier = sequelize.define('Tier', {\n        name: { type: DataTypes.STRING, allowNull: false },\n        currentPrice: { type: DataTypes.INTEGER, allowNull: false },\n        numberOfDomains: DataTypes.INTEGER,\n        maxPublishedWalkthroughs: DataTypes.INTEGER\n    }, {\n        classMethods: {\n            associate: function(models) {\n                Tier.hasMany(models.Subscription, { through: models.SubscriptionTier });\n                //Other relationships omitted...\n            }\n        }\n    });\n```\n",

How can I make these additional attributes accessible from my models? I had previously been using the selectedValues property but now that it's gone I need to find another way. Here is an example (I'm using squel to write the queries):\n\n```\nvar query = squel.select()\n    .field('users.*')\n    .field('count(signs.*)', 'sign_count')\n    .from('users')\n    .left_join('signs', null, 'signs.created_by = users.id')\n    .where('users.deleted_at is null')\n    .where('signs.deleted_at is null')\n    .group('users.id')\n    .order('users.created_at', false);\n\n  sequelize\n    .query(query.toString())\n    .error(next)\n    .success(function(users) {\n      // ...\n    });\n```\n\nSo I am joining the signs table to get a count of signs for each user. This is not very complicated and could maybe be done with the sequelize's count functionality, but there are a number of places where I'm doing more complex joins, like here where I am joining three tables and using an attribute from the third table and attaching it to rows on the first:\n\n```\n  var query = squel.select()\n    .field('signs.*')\n    .field('sponsors.image_url', 'sponsor_logo_url')\n    .from('signs')\n    .left_join('campaigns', null, 'campaigns.id = signs.campaign_id')\n    .left_join('sponsors', null, 'sponsors.id = campaigns.sponsor_id')\n    .where('signs.deleted_at is null')\n    .order('signs.created_at', false);\n```\n",

(Sorry I had been using the docs instead of the Wiki - doesn't look like this has made it into the docs yet.)\n\nThere are a lot places where I'm doing custom joins and queries to attach sub-elements and counts to my model instances, and my models would be become cluttered with virtual attributes if I had to add a new virtual attribute for every one-off scenario.\n\nFor example, I have a User model which `hasMany` Sign models:\n\n/models/user.js:\n\n```\nmodule.exports = function(Sequelize, DataTypes) {\n\n  return Sequelize.define('user', {\n    'id': {\n      type: DataTypes.INTEGER,\n      autoIncrement: true,\n      primaryKey: true,\n      unique: true,\n    },\n    'first_name': {\n      type: DataTypes.STRING,\n    },\n    'last_name': {\n      type: DataTypes.STRING,\n    },\n  }, {\n    instanceMethods: {\n    },\n    underscored: true,\n    paranoid: true,\n  });\n\n};\n```\n\nassociation:\n\n```\nUser.hasMany(Sign, { foreignKey: 'created_by' });\n```\n\nsign.js:\n\n```\nmodule.exports = function(Sequelize, DataTypes) {\n\n  return Sequelize.define('sign', {\n    'id': {\n      type: DataTypes.INTEGER,\n      autoIncrement: true,\n      primaryKey: true,\n    },\n    'created_by': {\n      type: DataTypes.INTEGER,\n    },\n    'sponsor_logo_url': {\n      type: DataTypes.VIRTUAL,\n    },\n    // ... took out some irrelevant attributes for brevity ...\n  }, {\n    instanceMethods: {\n      getSponsorLogoURL: function() {\n        // used to be `return this.selectedValues['sponsor_logo_url'];`\n        return this.getDataValue('sponsor_logo_url');\n      },\n    },\n    underscored: true,\n    paranoid: true,\n  });\n```\n\nI query for users or lists of users in probably 50 different places in my project. Sometimes I add a virtual property called \"sign_count\". Sometimes I add a virtual property \"signs\" as a list of sign objects.\n\nHere is the query I use in one place where I'm getting a list of users with their sign counts:\n\n```\nSELECT users.*,\n       count(signs.*) AS \"sign_count\"\nFROM users\nLEFT JOIN signs ON (signs.created_by = users.id)\nWHERE (users.deleted_at IS NULL)\n  AND (signs.deleted_at IS NULL)\nGROUP BY users.id\nORDER BY users.created_at DESC\n```\n\nIn another place, I query for campaigns (a campaign hasMany signs) and then aggregating their associated signs. I don't want to have to add a `signs` virtual property to the Campaign model just for this one situation:\n\n```\nSELECT campaigns.*,\n       json_agg(signs.*) AS \"signs\"\nFROM campaigns\nLEFT JOIN signs ON (signs.campaign_id = campaigns.id)\nWHERE (campaigns.created_by = 1)\n  AND (campaigns.deleted_at IS NULL)\nGROUP BY campaigns.id\nORDER BY campaigns.created_at DESC\n```\n\nTo reiterate, I don't think it's a good idea to add the virtual property `sign_count` to the User model in this case because it's a one-off situation. I feel like there should be a way to access attributes from a raw query like this without having to define a virtual attribute for every possible attribute that I might need to attach to the model in my raw queries.\n\nIt's totally possible that I'm pushing Sequelize beyond what it's intended to do though.\n"

    "body": "Trying to do a little more advanced queries with what I have setup and I'm running into a few issues. Looking for a nudge in the right direction. I have a model which contains three major objects `user`, `action`, and `actionValue`. The idea is that a user can take multiple actions multiple times and each of those actions are worth some amount of points.\n\nI'm trying to model the calculations for total points inside of a find statement to be used on a dashboard of sorts but I'm having troubles figuring out how to do all of this in Sequelize without using a custom query.\n\nHere's my data model.\n### User\n- id (int) - Auto-generated\n- username (string) - user input\n### Action\n- id (int) - Auto-generated\n- actionTypeId (int) - The ID for the corresponding action in the `actionType` model.\n- count (int) - Number of times the action has been done\n## Action Type\n- id (int) - Auto-generated\n- name (string) - Name of the action\n- value (int) - Number of points the action is worth.\n\nWhat I'm trying to do is retrieve a summary of the points for the user based on the type of action. To do this my `find()` statement looks like the following:\n\n``` js\nmodel.user.find(\n    {\n        where: {\n            username: 'bob'\n        },\n        include: [\n            {\n                model: model.action,\n                include: [ model.actionType ]\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n)\n```\n\nThis will retrieve for me the row on `user` that has a `username` of 'bob' and then retrieve all of their rows on the `action` table and the associated `actionType` record for each, sample below (represented as a JSON array of objects since it is too many fields for a table).\n\n``` js\n[\n  {\n   \"id\": 0\n   \"username\": \"bob\",\n   \"action.id\": 0,\n   \"action.actionTypeId\": 0,\n   \"action.count\": 5,\n   \"action.actionType.id\": 0,\n   \"action.actionType.name\": \"Lost Game\",\n   \"action.actionType.value\": 2\n  },\n  {\n   \"id\": 0\n   \"username\": \"bob\"\n   \"action.id\": 1\n   \"action.actionTypeId\": 1\n   \"action.count\": 3\n   \"action.actionType.id\": 0\n   \"action.actionType.name\": \"Won Game\",\n   \"action.actionType.value\": 10\n  }\n]\n```\n\nI could then parse through that data and I would come out with composite values by multiplying the number of times an action was taken with the value it holds. So for the data above I would see that the user `bob` got 10 points (5 \\* 2) for losing a total of 5 games, and then he got 30 points (3 \\* 10) for winning a total of 3 games giving `bob` a grand total of 40 points.\n\nSince I want to be able to utilize the ordering and other capabilities of the database I want to be able to calculate what I ran through above in my query instead of having to do it on the application server.\n\nIdeally I'm looking for output containing the following (again a JSON object because it is too large for a table):\n\n``` js\n{\n  \"id\": 0,\n  \"username\": \"bob\",\n  \"score\": 40 // This would be the `sum(action.count * action.actionType.value)`\n}\n```\n\nAny help on if this is feasible right now or not through the model would be much appreciated.

        "body": "Thanks, gave that a try and after some tweaking I was able to get it fairly close, just hitting an issue where `sequelize.fn()` combines the strings as comma-separated values (makes sense since it is a generic function generation function).\n\nWhat I ended up having to do was:\n\n``` js\nmodel.user.find(\n    {\n        where: {\n            username: 'bob'\n        },\n        include: [\n            {\n                model: model.action,\n                include: [ model.actionType ],\n                attributes: [\n                  [sequelize.fn('SUM', sequelize.col('action.count'), sequelize.literal('*'), sequelize('action.actionType.value')), 'score']\n                ]\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n)\n```\n\nThis ends up producing the following:\n\n``` sql\nSELECT \n    `user`.*,\n    SUM(`actions`.`count`, *, `actions.actionTypes`.`value`) AS `actions.score`,\n    `actions.actionTypes`.`id` AS `actions.actionTypes.id`,\n    `actions.actionTypes`.`name` AS `actions.actionTypes.name`,\n    `actions.actionTypes`.`value` AS `actions.actionTypes.value`,\n    `actions.actionTypes`.`createdAt` AS `actions.actionTypes.createdAt`,\n    `actions.actionTypes`.`updatedAt` AS `actions.actionTypes.updatedAt`\nFROM\n    (SELECT \n        `user`.`id`,\n        `user`.`username`\n    FROM\n        `users` AS `user`\n    WHERE\n        `user`.`username` = 'bob'\n    LIMIT 1) AS `user`\n        LEFT OUTER JOIN\n    `actions` AS `actions` ON `user`.`id` = `actions`.`userId`\n        LEFT OUTER JOIN\n    `actionTypes` AS `actions.actionTypes` ON `actions.actionTypeId`.`id` = `actions`.`actionTypeId`\n\n```\n\nYou'll notice it has the following `SUM('actions'.'count', *, 'actions.actionTypes'.'value')` which is invalid syntax for SQL. Seems like the last piece (outside of adding my group by statements) is just figuring out how I can join those in the SUM function through sequelize.\n\nThe reason why I had to do: `[sequelize.fn('SUM', sequelize.col('action.count'), sequelize.literal('*'), sequelize('action.actionType.value')), 'score']` instead of the more literal version that you suggested is because `sequelize.fn()` expects what is sent to it to be one of the sequelize types so that it can use the query generator and `sequelize.col()` (along with the others) expects to be called with a query generator when `toString()` is called.\n\nThis might be the point where I have to do it with string literals, and I'm honestly okay with that. I think my use is a specialized case and I have yet to find any ORM that could even come this close to doing this complex query.\n"

By default, the values from dataValues can also be accessed directly from the Instance, that is:\n> \n> instance.field\n> // is the same as\n> instance.get('field')\n> // is the same as\n> instance.getDataValue('field')\n\nSo my goal was displaying User properties on my index.dust file. First I tried:\n\n```\napp.get('/dashboard',isLoggedIn, function(req, res) {\n      res.render('dashboard', {\n          user : req.user //  the values from dataValues can also be accessed directly from the Instance\n    });\n});\n```\n\n... and on the view:\n\n```\n<li><a hred=\"#\">{user.username}</a></li>\n```\n\n... but the result was an anchor without the username. The reason of this was because I had to define user like: req.user.**dataValues** instead just req.user.\n\nIs this the expected behavior, should I always expose my record instances using  **dataValues** ??\n\nThanks\n",

    "body": "I have this association, with paranoid mode activate, using sequelize `2.0.0-dev12`:\n\n```\nCampaign.hasMany(models.offer);\nOffer.hasMany(models.campaign, { onDelete: 'RESTRICT' });\n```\n\nWhen I remove an `Offer` through `.destroy`, here's the query's that emitted:\n\n```\nUPDATE \"Offers\" SET [...],\"createdAt\"='2014-08-26 12:43:01.939 +00:00',\"updatedAt\"='2014-08-26 12:53:04.628 +00:00',\"deletedAt\"='2014-08-26 12:53:04.628 +00:00',\"MerchantId\"=1,\"ProductId\"=1 WHERE \"id\"=3 RETURNING *\n```\n\nI thought the RESTRICT will prevent deleting an `Offer` if its reference in the `CampaignsOffers` join table. Anyway, the entry corresponding to that association is still present in the join table `CampaignsOffers` (I think this is intentional as the filter is such as we retrieve `Offers` where `Offers.deletedAt != NULL`). When I retrieve a campaign and eager load its associated offers though, I sometimes get this kind of results:\n\n```\nstorefront_1 |   [{ id: null,\n[...]\nstorefront_1 |     createdAt: null,\nstorefront_1 |     updatedAt: null,\nstorefront_1 |     deletedAt: null,\nstorefront_1 |     MerchantId: null,\nstorefront_1 |     ProductId: null,\nstorefront_1 |     campaignsOffer: \nstorefront_1 |      { createdAt: '2014-08-26T13:00:24.766Z',\nstorefront_1 |        updatedAt: '2014-08-26T13:00:24.766Z',\nstorefront_1 |        OfferId: 3,\nstorefront_1 |        CampaignId: 1 } } ]\n```\n\nThoughts?\n",

In this case, I'm getting `missing FROM-clause entry for table`, which is an issue typically related to column naming. I have triple checked the raw query in this case, and there is no problem.\n\nSo, like the poster here, I need to have the subquery logic have `required:true`, and this is causing the `where` logic to go into the `JOIN AND`, rather than the outer `WHERE`. If I move the `where` logic to the outside the include, and reference the nested properties by col name, query is built with `WHERE` rather than `JOIN` filtering, and executes fine.\n\nTL;DR, you mention here: \"we need a way users can tell sequelize whether to place the where on the inner or outer query,\" has that been done yet?\n"

This is good, it's intuitive, and will grow with the model seamlessly.\n\n`Client.findOrCreate(formData)` tries to run \n\n``` sql\nSELECT * \nFROM   Person \nWHERE Person.FirstName = 'Mick' \nAND       Person.LastName = 'Hanson' \nAND       Person.Car = 'Mustang' \nAND       Person.Life = 'Good' \n```\n\nThis elicits complaints from the database about unknown columns (not unreasonably as Car and Life are not columns in the Person table).\n\nI had anticipated that the two functions would deal with the POJO in the same way, and refer only to the relevant attributes.\n\nThe work around is to generate a POJO which contains only the attributes relevant to each model, and pass that to `.findOrCreate()`. \n\nI believe that this would be better done inside `.findOrCreate()` because it would align the functionality with that of `.create()`, promote cleaner user code, and allow for models to be altered without effectively 'hard coding' the relevant attributes in multiple places.\n",

    "body": "Alright, this may seem kind of crazy but please try to follow along.  I'm hoping there's a simple solution.\n\nI've found that when providing a complete \"document\" to my angular client of a user account...\n\n```\nUser.find(\n    {\n        where:whereObj,\n        order: '\"People\".\"gender\" DESC',\n        include:[\n            {\n                model: Person,\n                as: \"People\",\n                include:[\n                    {\n                        model: PersonalTrait,\n                        as: \"Traits\"\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                model: Media,\n                as: \"PrimaryMedia\"\n            },\n            {\n                model: MediaFolder,\n                as: \"MediaFolders\",\n                include:[\n                    {\n                        model: Media,\n                        as: \"Media\"\n                    }\n                ]\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n).success(function(user){\n    if(user === null){\n        res.send(404);\n    }else{\n        res.json(200, user);\n   }\n}).error(function(err){\n    res.send(400);\n});\n```\n\nI see the database query resulting in exponential rows, depending on the number of rows for Traits, MediaFolders and Media.  For example...  1 User row has 2 People rows and 2 MediaFolder rows produces 4 rows in Sequelize's query to produce the object.  Adding 2 MediaRows linked to a MediaFolder row produces 6 rows. Adding 2 Traits to the User now produces 9 rows.  20 traits = 63 rows.  20 traits & 12 media = 252 rows.\n\nI'm fairly certain I understand why this is and that I'm using Sequelize properly.  So I decided to try taking a different approach by first getting the basic User object with everything but the Media Folders, then getting those media folders and \"injecting\" them into the User object result.\n\n```\nUser.find(\n    {\n        where:whereObj,\n        order: '\"People\".\"gender\" DESC',\n        include:[\n            {\n                model: Person,\n                as: \"People\",\n                include:[\n                    {\n                        model: PersonalTrait,\n                        as: \"Traits\"\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                model: Media,\n                as: \"PrimaryMedia\"\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n).success(function(user){\n    if(user === null){\n        res.send(404);\n    }else{\n\n        MediaFolder.findAll(\n            {\n                where: {\n                    \"UserId\": user.id\n                },\n                include:[\n                    {\n                        model: Media,\n                        as: \"Media\"\n                    }\n                ]\n            }\n        ).success(function(mediaFolders){\n            user.mediaFolders = mediaFolders; // <-- pseudocode\n            res.json(200, user);\n        }).error(function(err){\n            res.send(400);\n        });\n   }\n}).error(function(err){\n    res.send(400);\n});\n```\n\nThe only problem is that I'm not sure how I can do this because that \"pseudocode\" line above didn't work.  :)\n",

Fine.\nBut when I call user.removeRestriction() I was expecting that restriction to be deleted from the database, but instead the foreign key was set to NULL.\n\nIs there a way to actually remove that restriction instead of setting the FK to NULL?\nThanks!\n",

Mind you I haven't looked at the code lately, so im just speaking from memory :).\n\nThe two dates you posted represent the same point in time:\n\n``` js\nd1 = new Date('2013-11-02 00:00:00Z')\nSat Nov 02 2013 01:00:00 GMT+0100 (W. Europe Standard Time)\nd2 = new Date('Sat Nov 01 2013 22:00:00 GMT-0200 (BRST)')\nSat Nov 02 2013 01:00:00 GMT+0100 (W. Europe Standard Time)\n\nd1.getTime()\n1383350400000\nd2.getTime()\n1383350400000\nd1.getTime() === d2.getTime()\ntrue\n```\n\nModel.date is a javascript Date object, and those are always in the local timezone. If you want to the get the UTC time of a Date, you will have to write custom logic using `.getUTCDate()` etc. When you pass a date object to sequelize it is converted to UTC before it is saved, not matter what local time zone it has. When you retrieve a date object is created, representing the UTC timestamp in the local timezone of your server. This means that even if you save a date from a server in one timezone and retrieve it from a server in another zone, the date objects will represent the _same point in time_ (their timestamps are equal), even though their `.toString()` representation will be different.\n\nIn short you should not take extra care to convert your dates to UTC before passing them to sequelize, sequelize will handle the conversion.\n"

I picked up Sequelize as an ORM mainly because it seemed like it is the most feature rich out of the many others.\n\nSo I started mapping my models from Rails in Sequelize (since I didn`t need all the columns I only mapped the necessary ones) and I ended up with a 1-n relationship that is done using :through in Rails. So I created the following ralationship:\n\n```\nHole.hasMany(TrackingGroup, {foreignKey: 'hole_id', joinTableName:'holes_tracking_groups', underscored: true, useJunctionTable: true}); \n\nTrackingGroup.belongsTo(Hole, {foreignKey: 'tracking_group_id', joinTableName: 'holes_tracking_groups'});\n```\n\nThe idea is that when I get all the tracking groups for a hole I will have a query in the holes_tracking_groups where the hole_id = \"something\" but instead I was having a query in the tracking_group table (the one that has all the tracking groups). Or in other words the specified joinTableName was not considered at all.\n",
