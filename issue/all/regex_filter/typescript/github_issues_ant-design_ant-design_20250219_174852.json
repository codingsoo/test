Because there are multiple instances where a shape can be formed, for these particular props (`wrapperCol` and `labelCol`) I would like to avoid writing the shape in each file or creating my own by copying/pasting with modification from the typescript file. I was hoping a readily made ColProps was available.

Is ColProps accessible anywhere in the current version?\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nIt would be nice to have ColProps available in some format like: \r\n```\r\nimport React from 'react';\r\nimport PropTypes from 'prop-types';\r\nimport { Col } from 'antd';\r\n\r\nconst ColProps = Col.PropShape;\r\nconst propTypes = {\r\n   layout = PropTypes.shape({\r\n     labelCol: ColProps,\r\n     wrapperCol: ColProps,\r\n  }),\r\n};\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by ant-design-issue-helper.

    "body": "\r\n看到几个issue里，提到Option和Input 展示分离的文档。我今天也搞了很久，觉得文档关于`optionLabelProp`的说明太简陋。\r\n\r\n除了 `value` 和 `children`，也可以是自定义属性名，比如 如果`Option`按如下形式render，\r\n```javascrpit\r\n      <Option\r\n        dataItem={item}\r\n        key={item.id}\r\n        customText={item.name}\r\n      >\r\n        {item.description}\r\n      </Option>\r\n```\r\n那么可以设置`optionLabelProp`为`customText`，这样的话展示可以完全自定义。\r\n\r\n另外如果是上面的写法，`onSelect`回调里，第二个参数`option`, 可以通过`option.props.dataItem` 拿到原始数据。\r\n\r\n我感觉这两个例子对于使用select来说，有必要在例子里说明一下",
