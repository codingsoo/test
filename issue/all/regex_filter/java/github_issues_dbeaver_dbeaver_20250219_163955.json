If I export from the table to a new table in MySQL, only 9878 rows are inserted. There are no errors displayed during the export or in the Error Log.\r\n\r\nIf I set result set size to 12000 and select * from table, grid shows 11433 rows, but export from there as well only inserts 9878 rows.\r\n\r\nI am inserting into a table that does not exist, so there should be no constraints getting in the way.\r\n\r\nIf I export to CSV, the resulting file has 11433 records, but this format is not usable. I did this just for comparison to confirm all of the data was extracted from the source.\r\n\r\nFileMaker tables with smaller number of rows successfully transferred all rows, but other tables w/ large number of rows also only imported a subset.\r\n\r\nHow do I get more visibility into which rows are not inserted and why? Any tricks to get all rows to be transferred?\r\n\r\n\r\n### DBeaver Version\r\n\r\nCommunity 22.2.5\r\n\r\n### Operating System\r\n\r\nWindows 10\r\n\r\n### Database and driver\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\n_No response_",

Please describe.**\r\n\r\nMore often than not, I overwrite the results of a results tab b/c I'm too focused on the current query I am trying to make.\r\n\r\nIt's usually not so bad b/c the query which made the lost result set is in the same console window.  So I can just rerun the query.  But, sometimes I don't have it, and I lose that work.  I don't often save these queries, because they are temporary, but they took me some time to iron out.  Or many times, the query that I have saved takes several minutes to reproduce.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nAfter a result tab appears with the results of a query.  We should be able to right click the result tab and just mark the tab as keep/locked for session.  You should be able to toggle it off in the same manner.\r\n\r\nThen, in the sql console, if you press 'play' and that will  overwrite the current locked result set, dbeaver will warn you:\r\n\r\n'Cannot overwrite locked result set.  Either press play in another tab or unlock the result set.'\r\n\r\nNow have an option to 'close all unlocked result tabs'.  Or maybe modify the behavior of 'close all result tabs' so that it doesn't kill the locked results.  Finally, if you implement the 'close result tabs to the right/left', the close operation should skip the locked result tabs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n\r\nNo alternative but to recreate/rerun the query to reproduce the lost results.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nNone.  Keep up the good work.\r\n",

    "body": "Hello,\r\nUnfortunately, at my company, I have to keep working with DB2 mainframe z/OS.  I have to use a specific JRE (Java 1.8) or I can't query my tables containing timestamps due to a well known legacy EDIC/CP1027 encoding issue.  Prior to recent versions of dbeaver, I could just drop my JRE folder into dbeaver's root folder and then I'm good to go.  Now however, that is not possible.  Are there some additional modifications I can do to continue using my existing JRE with recent versions of dbeaver or am I stuck with version 7.3.0?  If there is no way to get my local JRE version to work with current versions of dbeaver, that is fine, but just wanted to make sure there isn't some other workaround.  I appreciate all the work that has been put into dbeaver!",

Any filter would take as much time to run.\r\n\r\nAlso, once fixed, a single-key shortcut to filter by the selected cell value would be super useful !",

Is that a good idea? How to change the default? Where is it cached?\r\n  * A drop/create table/view/synonym should modify the cache. Does it for other databases?\r\n  * How can a user force the suggestion list to be invalidated and reloaded? Found no traces of that.\r\n  * When the user does refresh the database navigator, shouldn't that update the impacted parts of the suggestion list?\r\n* Object types: The suggestion list is called with an object type but what should it return?\r\n  * Per my finding the suggestion list for TABLE should return all objects a user can use in select-from clauses. So tables, views, synonyms. Correct?\r\n  * That raises the question on when the type VIEW is provided. The only use case I can see is when a user types \"drop view ...\". Then only views make sense.

    "body": "Hi Guys,\r\n\r\nI am new to SQL and I am trying to create some queries in DBeaver.  I have some questions regarding aggregation by using group by. I will use an example output table to explain (THIS IS THE OUTPUT by running my query):\r\n\r\nID                SubType     Data 1     Data 2   Data 3   Data 4\r\nSample 1       A               Null         Null       21          22\r\nSample 1       B               20            15         Null        Null\r\n\r\nSo in here, I have used where statement to select sample 1, then based on group by subtype, I can retrieve different information from Sample 1 (based on subtype, some data will be Null as shown from the table due to the reason that some data is only available for either A or B).  \r\n\r\nNow the first difficulty for me: I want to create a new column \"Data 5\" for part B and the formula will be using 20 from Data 1 column, 15 Data 2 column and 21 from Data 3 column - i.e. 20/(21-15).  Is this possible to make new output based on output results? Hope I don't confuse you here.\r\n\r\nSecond difficulty for me: Initially, I want to make a one row table for Sample 1. So basically, I don't want to group by subtype and just show Data 1 - Data 4 columns. However, my query has case and end as statements that search for keywords in Subtype column to retrieve info. Therefore, it forces me to use group by subtype (I guess??). I don't know what to do. Is there a way to make this simple? I  want to make something like this:\r\n\r\nID                    Data 1     Data 2   Data 3   Data 4\r\nSample 1              20       15            21          22\r\n\r\nIf my questions are confusing, I can paste my actual query in here and output results so you guys can better understand.\r\n\r\nThank you for your help!!!!",
