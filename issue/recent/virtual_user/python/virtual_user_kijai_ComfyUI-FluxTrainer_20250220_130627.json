      "body": "Hello,\r\n\r\nI was looking at the args.json file for some comparison and troubleshooting and saw this line:\r\n \r\n _\"caption_extension\": \".caption\",_\r\n\r\nIn my dataset, my images are tagged with a identically named _.txt_ . Does this line mean that I have inadvertently been training without image captions at all?\r\n\r\nIf so, how should I address this problem? Change my picture captions to _.caption_ or is there a setting that I need to change?\r\n\r\nThanks"
