      "body": "After installing git-remote-s3 with pip I had this issue when trying to clone :\r\n\r\n```\r\ngit clone s3://xxx/git-remote_xxx-iiot-cdk/\r\n```\r\n```\r\nCloning into 'git-remote_xxx-iiot-cdk'...\r\ngit: 'remote-s3' is not a git command. See 'git --help'.\r\n\r\nThe most similar command is\r\n        remote-fd\r\nfatal: remote helper 's3' aborted session\r\n``` \r\n\r\nBut it worked in a random python environment. \r\n\r\nAlso if I add the ./venv/Scripts that contains the git-remote-s3.exe to my Path, I can clone from anywhere, but it will probably stop working if I ever delete the python environment I took the git-remote-s3.exe from.
