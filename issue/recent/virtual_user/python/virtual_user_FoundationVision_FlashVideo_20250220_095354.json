      "title": "missing sat.model",
      "body": "Hello, thank you for open-sourcing such an excellent work !\n\nBut when I run `sat/demo.ipynb`, an error will be reported at the line from `sat.model.base_model import get_model`, prompting that `sat.model cannot be found`. \nI see that there is indeed no model folder in the sat, and there is no `get_model` function in the `base_model` file. Is it because a file was uploaded missing?"
