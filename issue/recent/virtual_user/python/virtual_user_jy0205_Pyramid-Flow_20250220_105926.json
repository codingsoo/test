      "title": "About training detail",
      "body": "Hi, thanks for sharing the great project.\r\n\r\nI have found the mmdit in your method can accept different stages as input, and different stage are concatenated in token dimension. This may require the timestep to be same in different stages but different stages have their respective timestep interval. I wonder if the training sampled for each batch only include one stage, or my understanding is wrong in something. Looking forward for your reply, and thanks again for the excellent project!"
