      "body": "First of all, thank you for your excellent work. The community thrives because of you. When I was looking at your code, I was very interested in your filtering strategy, because we can't always find a suitable standard to filter the structures generated by AFD or RF+MPNN, so I carefully checked your weight file. I found that your weights for hotspot_RMSDhe Binder_RMSD are positive and usually large. Generally speaking, if the RMSD of the target structure in a trajectory is large, doesn't it mean that the prediction is not very reliable? The weight treatment in the code is a simple addition, so if the RMSD is large, will this cause the ranking of unreliable trajectories to rise?"
