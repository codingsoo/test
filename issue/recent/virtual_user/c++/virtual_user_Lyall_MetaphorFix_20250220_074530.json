      "body": "Hi Lyall.\r\n\r\nI have an issue on my side whenever I set the Game Window to true.\r\nWhenever I close the game it seems that a process keeps on running and I have to manually shut it down with task manager.\r\nEven though the game is closed, music keeps on playing.\r\n\r\nI don't know how much more I can provide here to help but anything I can do to help solve this issue feel free to ask back.\r\n\r\nEdit: On a sidenote I noticed this because for some reason setting this to true allowed me to be able to enter the characters name at the start while it being false did not.\r\nAlso I am using specialK because of not having true borderless fullscreen (and wanted the game running the audio when tabbed out)\r\n\r\nThanks in advance and also thanks for the other amazing features coming from this fix.\r\n\r\n"
