      "title": "2bit Packing logic post Bit Balance Strategy",
      "body": "I want some more understanding on how to pack the 2 bit weights after using bit balance strategy. \r\n\r\nWhile running blockwise quantization we have increased our range from 4 to 5 and values to {-2,-1,0,1,2}. After running the ABQ LLM for 2 bit, I will be having float weights which are good to quantize to 2 bits, but the problem here is with the packing logic. \r\n1.  How to represent the above range using 2 bits and pack them ?\r\n2.  If we use default 2 bit quantization, won't I lose the benefit of bit balance strategy ?"
