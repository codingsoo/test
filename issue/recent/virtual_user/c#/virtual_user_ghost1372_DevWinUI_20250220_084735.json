      "title": "[Question] Best practice for ThemeService in multi-window application?",
      "body": "Hi,\r\n\r\nWhen using the ThemeService, it must be initialized with the window as a parameter.  In a multi-window app, should a new ThemeService be created for each window and its settings set to the main application window's settings?  Or should the main window's ThemeService just call .Initialize() on the newly created window?\r\n\r\nAlso, what is the best method for applying changes to the settings (tint color, backdrop) to all open windows?  If the above answer is to create a separate TheemService for each window, should I just apply the settings to each window's ThemeService in a loop?\r\n\r\nThanks!"
