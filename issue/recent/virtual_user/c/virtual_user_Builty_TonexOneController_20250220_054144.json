      "body": "Hello. Great project by the way. I could flash the latest client firmware on the ESP32 Zero, but the BT is not connecting. Tried the new beta in the Special folder. So now the Chocolate is connecting, but Preset changes are not possible. It is only possible to switch from A to B on Tonex One Pedal and with a step on Chocolate it changes back to A. But after that nothing else works. And I noticed that every time when I reset the Waveshare via the button the A/B of the presets on the Tonex Pedal are changed to another preset. Maybe you can help me."
