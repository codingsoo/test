    "initial_question": {
      "title": "The order of labels issue",
      "body": "If the nodes are numbered from 1 to n, and n is a two-digit number, then Current Nodes will sort the nodes in lexicographical order, such as `1 10 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9`, while the order of labels given in the problem is often `1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10`, which makes editing labels very annoying.\r\n\r\nOne solution I came up with is to add a switch to adjust the sorting method, switching between lexicographical order and numerical order from smallest to largest. However, when there are non-numerical values in Current Nodes, the numerical order from smallest to largest should be disabled"
    },
    "satisfaction_conditions": [
      "Numerical values must be displayed in numerical order (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 10) rather than lexicographical order (1, 10, 2, 3)",
      "The system must handle mixed content (numerical and non-numerical values) appropriately",
      "The sorting behavior must be consistent and predictable"
