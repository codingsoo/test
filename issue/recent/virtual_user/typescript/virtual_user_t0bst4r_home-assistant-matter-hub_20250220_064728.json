For example i have a smart plug called \"living room TV\" in home assistant that i want to name just \"TV\" in alexa. However, if i restart the bridge, the name is \"living room TV\" after that and the group i assigned in the alexa app is gone. On Homekit this is no issue, the names and rooms persist after a restart of HAMH. \r\nIs there a way to fix this?"
