      "title": "cline checkpoints results in constant password prompts if commit signing is enabled",
      "body": "### What happened?\n\nOnce I upgraded cline to 3.1.0 I started getting popups about my gpg password after every cline action. This is rather disrupting. The reason is that we sign commits by default and cline creates checkpoint commits using the default git configuration, so it also tries to sign every commit. It would be nice to either have a way to disable checkpoint feature, or prevent git from using global config by setting `GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL=/dev/null` when calling git to commit the checkpoint.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. enable commit signing in the default git config using: `git config --global commit.gpgSign true`. You also need gpg to be configured.\r\n2. try using cline, you should see pop-ups for a password on every step\r\n\r\n\n\n### Relevant API REQUEST output\n\n_No response_\n\n### Operating System\n\nMacOS\n\n### Cline Version\n\n3.1.2\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_"
