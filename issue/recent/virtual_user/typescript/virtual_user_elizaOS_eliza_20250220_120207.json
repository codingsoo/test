      "title": "Log in info safe on character.json file vs .env?",
      "body": "Just a quick question about the safety of inputting our login information for social media platforms on the files. Is it safe to input them on the character.json file under \"secrets\", or is it better to have them in the .env?\r\n\r\n What if you are running more than one character? Is there a way to add 2 different login info for the same platform (e.g twitter, or discord) in the .env and have them be assigned to different characters.json?"

      "Multiple sets of credentials for the same platform must be uniquely identifiable",
