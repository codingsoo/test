Just install and show toast\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nWithout warning\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\nIf applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem.\r\n\r\n**Environment info**\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  Please provide the version of the libraries below.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n| Library                      | Version |\r\n| ---------------------------- | ------- |\r\n| sonner-native                | 0.14.1  |\r\n| react-native                 | 0.75.3   |\r\n| react-native-reanimated      |3.15.2  |\r\n| react-native-gesture-handler | 2.19.0  |\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nAdd any other context about the problem here.\r\n"
