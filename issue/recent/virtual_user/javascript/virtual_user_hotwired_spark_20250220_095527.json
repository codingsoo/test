      "title": "Reloading application.css when constituent files are changed (Sprockets)",
      "body": "Thanks for making this! :star_struck: We're still running sprockets, so it was nice to see #41 adding basic sprockets support \u2013 thanks for that @codergeek121!\r\n\r\nI was still struggling to make it work, and have had to make some modifications to get to a walking skeleton of CSS reloading:\r\n\r\n1. Add some subfolders of `app/assets/stylesheets` to `css_paths`\r\n1. Add `scss` to `css_extensions`\r\n1. Monkey patch `Hotwire::Spark::Change#canonical_changed_path` to always return \"/application.css\" when `action == :reload_css`.\r\n\r\nThe first two points was necessary for any events to get fired in the first place, as my CSS is mainly defined in scss files in subfolders of `app/assets/stylesheets`, imported in `app/assets/stylesheets/application.scss`. Part 3 was to get `application.css` reloaded, in stead of the constituent file that was actually modified.\r\n\r\nIs there something I've misunderstood here? If not, perhaps some additions could be made to streamline this a bit :thinking: "
