      "body": "Hi,\n\nThanks for this great tool.\n\nI have one question regarding understanding.\n\nToday I set up paperless-ai and successfully scanned over 400 documents. Tags and types are working fine, and all documents have an \"ai-processed\" tag.\n\nNow I decided to change many settings in the \"Prompt Description\" to optimize the output. I thought I could simply rescan everything and that the optimized prompts would be applied to all documents, but it's not working.\n\nHow can I rescan all documents with the new Prompt Description?\n\nThanks a lot.\n"
