The second if should definitely not be there now that we have hybrid querying (we also select nodes based on query similarity like in graphrag/lightrag). Since you spotted this, I'd be happy if you issued a pull request that skips the embedding step for the entities if there are none and only uses the query in that case. I can also do that if you prefer :)"

I\u2019ll take a look and implement some logic similar to MS graphrag/lightrag.\r\n\r\nAhah, no need to do that (but I'm very happy to chat about it if you're keen to) :) I simply thought that it would have been nice for you to contribute to the repo by changing the couple of lines of code of that wrong `if`, but no worries if it's too bothering, I can do that.\r\nBasically the if should be around\r\n```python\r\nvdb_entity_scores_by_name = await self._score_entities_by_vectordb(\r\n        query_embeddings=query_embeddings[:-1], top_k=1\r\n)\r\n```\r\ninstead of returning None."
