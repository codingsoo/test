    "body": "### Question\r\nHi, I'm wondering if it's possible to disable certain parts of Docling to speed up processing.\r\n\r\nI'm processing PDFs of academic papers, and I'm not interested in any tabular data. What I would like to do is disable all OCR and all table parsing, since I'll never use these features for this particular problem.\r\n\r\nIs this possible? I can't tell from the documentation how to do it, if so.\r\n",
