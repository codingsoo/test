    "body": "No matter what I try I can't get the audio files to generate. I've tried all the different tts models but none of the work. I also don't see any files inside `./data/audio`. The script exits with the error below.\n\n```sh\nError merging audio files: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\nError converting text to speech: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n2025-01-31 16:01:45,871 - __main__ - ERROR - An error occurred in the process_content function: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\nAn error occurred: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n```\n\nWhen I check my OpenAI API usage, I can see that the TTS HD endpoint is being used, so it seems that something fails when trying to save the audio file(s).\n\nAlso, the `./data/audio` folder gets created correctly but I don't see the `temp_audio_dir` folder. Could this be the issue?\n\nRunning on Ubuntu inside a separate Python env.\n\nAny help is appreciated.",

        "body": "I think i can help.\n\nThe issue is likely due to how the file is being handled by pydub after ffmpeg processes it. \n\nEnsure you have the latest version of pydub and ffmpeg.\n\nYou need to install the system-level ffmpeg binary, which pydub uses to process audio files.\n\nYou may need to explicitly tell pydub where to find both ffmpeg and ffprobe.\n\nYou can do this by setting the environment variables FFMPEG_BINARY and FFPROBE_BINARY in your Python code before using pydub.\n\nIf i can help further let me know."
