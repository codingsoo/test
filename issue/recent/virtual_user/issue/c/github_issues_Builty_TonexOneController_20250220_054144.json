So now the Chocolate is connecting, but Preset changes are not possible. It is only possible to switch from A to B on Tonex One Pedal and with a step on Chocolate it changes back to A. But after that nothing else works. And I noticed that every time when I reset the Waveshare via the button the A/B of the presets on the Tonex Pedal are changed to another preset. Maybe you can help me.",
