    "body": "### What happened?\n\nOnce I upgraded cline to 3.1.0 I started getting popups about my gpg password after every cline action. This is rather disrupting. The reason is that we sign commits by default and cline creates checkpoint commits using the default git configuration, so it also tries to sign every commit. It would be nice to either have a way to disable checkpoint feature, or prevent git from using global config by setting `GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL=/dev/null` when calling git to commit the checkpoint.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. enable commit signing in the default git config using: `git config --global commit.gpgSign true`. You also need gpg to be configured.\r\n2. try using cline, you should see pop-ups for a password on every step\r\n\r\n\n\n### Relevant API REQUEST output\n\n_No response_\n\n### Operating System\n\nMacOS\n\n### Cline Version\n\n3.1.2\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",

The Cache Count seems to rise and bill keeps going up but it acts like it doesn't know what it just did. It keeps apologizing and has to then add in the deleted code it erased. this is costing allot of tokens. I went through the troubleshooting section and tried to address it that way but it seems to happen every time and becomes taxing. Claude Website and OpenAI chat sessions seem to handle it better. This tool has a long way to go to handle existing code bases that more than a few classes.  \r\n\r\nSAMPLE RESPONSE:\r\nI apologize for the oversight. It seems that some methods were accidentally removed or not included in our previous update. Let's add the missing methods back to the BackgroundService.cs file. I'll update the file with the missing methods while keeping our previous changes intact."
