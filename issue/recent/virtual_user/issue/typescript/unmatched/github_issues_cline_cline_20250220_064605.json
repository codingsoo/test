    "body": "### Which API Provider are you using?\n\nOpenRouter\n\n### Which Model are you using?\n\nClaude 3.5 Sonnet\n\n### What happened?\n\nThe revert block feature works up until you click the save button. Then it responds by saying something like \"Thank you for showing me the complete code, I'll now provide the complete code...\" and then it starts over as if the block wasn't inserted and saved. In summary, if it's actually saving the inserted blocks of missing code, it's telling the API something different.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Click the revert block button\r\n2. Click save\r\n3. Notice that the API still tries working on the file when it shouldn't.\r\n\n\n### Relevant API REQUEST output\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",

I've adjusted the `write_to_file` tool response so that now it's more clear that the file's contents are updated and the model should course correct accordingly, rather than trying to re-apply the edit.
