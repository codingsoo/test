        "body": "Hiya @DerpcatMusic! sorry for the late response. \r\n\r\nYeah this issue happens because Apple has increased restriction with Gatekeeper on the newer versions of MacOS. Luckily, there is a way to still make it work.\r\n\r\n1. **Open Terminal**:\r\n   - You can open Terminal from the Applications > Utilities folder, or press `Cmd + Space`, type \"Terminal,\" and hit Enter.\r\n\r\n2. **Navigate to the App Location**:\r\n   - Use the `cd` command to go to the folder where your app is located. For example, if the app is in the Downloads folder, you would type:\r\n     ```bash\r\n     cd ~/Downloads\r\n     ```\r\n\r\n3. **Remove the Quarantine Attribute**:\r\n   - Run the following command, replacing `Comet.app` with the actual name of your app:\r\n     ```bash\r\n     xattr -d com.apple.quarantine Comet.app\r\n     ```\r\n   - This removes the quarantine flag that macOS automatically sets on downloaded applications, which is what blocks it from opening.\r\n\r\n4. **Open the App**:\r\n   - Now that the quarantine attribute has been removed, you should be able to open the app by double-clicking it in Finder.\r\n\r\n#### Alternative: If You\u2019re Using a Path\r\n\r\nIf your app is in a custom location or has spaces in the name, you may want to use the full path. Here\u2019s an example:\r\n```bash\r\nxattr -d com.apple.quarantine \"~/Downloads/Comet.app\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Verification\r\n\r\nYou can check if the quarantine attribute was successfully removed by running:\r\n```bash\r\nxattr Comet.app\r\n```\r\nIf `com.apple.quarantine` no longer appears in the output, the quarantine flag has been successfully removed. \r\n\r\nLet me know if you run into any more issues!"
