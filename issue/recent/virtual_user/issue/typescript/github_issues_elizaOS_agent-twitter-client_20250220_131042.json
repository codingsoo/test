    "body": "Saw there is update in the code and sendTweetWithMedia is removed and image can be sent using sendTweet, I tried but it posted without the image.\r\nhere's the part of code - \r\n```   const img = await fetch(imgUrl);\r\n      const arrayBuffer = await img.arrayBuffer();\r\n      const imgBuffer = Buffer.from(arrayBuffer);\r\n      const response = await scraper.sendTweet(replyText, tweetId, {data:imgBuffer,mediaType: 'image/jpeg'} );\r\n```\r\nIt works with sendTweetWithMedia(), just putting the imgBuffer in array, as it needs Buffer[]",
