You don't want both MetaphorFix and SpecialK setting a new WndProc. This is why I added the option, specifically for those using SpecialK."

I know that SpecialK has a ton of input related settings you can tweak that might have caused that? It could also just have been some bugginess on the game side. I'd just be speculating as to what would have caused that issue for you."
