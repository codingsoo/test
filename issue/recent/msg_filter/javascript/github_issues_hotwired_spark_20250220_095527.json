    "body": "Thanks for making this! :star_struck: We're still running sprockets, so it was nice to see #41 adding basic sprockets support \u2013 thanks for that @codergeek121!\r\n\r\nI was still struggling to make it work, and have had to make some modifications to get to a walking skeleton of CSS reloading:\r\n\r\n1. Add some subfolders of `app/assets/stylesheets` to `css_paths`\r\n1. Add `scss` to `css_extensions`\r\n1. Monkey patch `Hotwire::Spark::Change#canonical_changed_path` to always return \"/application.css\" when `action == :reload_css`.\r\n\r\nThe first two points was necessary for any events to get fired in the first place, as my CSS is mainly defined in scss files in subfolders of `app/assets/stylesheets`, imported in `app/assets/stylesheets/application.scss`. Part 3 was to get `application.css` reloaded, in stead of the constituent file that was actually modified.\r\n\r\nIs there something I've misunderstood here? If not, perhaps some additions could be made to streamline this a bit :thinking: ",

        "body": "I don't think you misunderstood! Currently, there's only basic support for Sprockets, meaning it simply doesn't raise an error if you're using Sprockets. There's no support for sass/scss/coffeescript right now. I think this would also be kind of hard to add in a non-buggy way, without parsing sass imports.\r\n\r\nIf you don't want to monkey patch, you could also try the following instead:\r\n\r\n1. Change the reload method to `:replace`, since this will also reload the `<head>` if there are changes\r\n2. Add the `scss` extension and paths to the **html_paths** and **html_extensions**, which will then trigger an `:replace` reload if a `scss` file is changed\r\n\r\nThis will not do a fine-grained css reload, but a full Turbo visit instead, but maybe this is good enough for your use case."
