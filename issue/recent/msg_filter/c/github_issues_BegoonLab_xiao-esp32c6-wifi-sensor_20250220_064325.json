        "body": "Hi @jeffbrown57 ,\r\n\r\nThe monitor is silent, probably because log output is disabled. To enable it, go to the menu:\r\n```sh\r\nidf.py menuconfig\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen navigate to , `Component config` \u2192 `Log output` \u2192 `Default log verbosity`\r\n\r\nand set it to `Info`. Save the configuration, build, and flash again with the monitor using:\r\n```sh\r\nidf.py -p <device/port> build flash monitor.\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou should now see the output. Feel free to ask for help if needed!"
