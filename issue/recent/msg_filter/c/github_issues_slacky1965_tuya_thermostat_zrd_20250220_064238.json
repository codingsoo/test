    "body": "Hi,\r\n\r\nThank you for this firmware, I have a couple of these (Tuya_Thermostat_r01) and they are working well for me on 1.0.07.\r\n\r\nI am trying to update them to the 1.0.08 version. I have `local_ota_index.json` as specified and have confirmed it is being used by z2m. I have the `1141-d3a3-1111114b-tuya_thermostat_zrd.zigbee` present in the images subfolder.\r\n\r\nDespite this, z2m says there is no update available when checking these devices.\r\n\r\nI have since tried updating my z2m and the configuration from this repo to the 2.0 version however the new `local_ota_index.json` specifies an extra entry for `tuya_thermostat_zrd.zigbee` \r\n\r\n```\r\n    {\r\n        \"url\": \"images/tuya_thermostat_zrd.zigbee\"\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich gives an error in z2m as this file doesn't exist. What should this file be? A copy of the full name `1141-d3a3-1111114b-tuya_thermostat_zrd.zigbee` or something else?\r\n\r\nIf I remove the new entry in `local_ota_index.json` I have the same behaviour as the pre-2.0 version, no updates available for the devices.\r\n\r\nThanks again!",

And leave the previous entry in **local_ota_index.json**. \r\n\r\n```\r\n    {\r\n        \"url\": \"images/tuya_thermostat_zrd.zigbee\"\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen you won't need to restart **zigbee2mqtt** every time before updating."
