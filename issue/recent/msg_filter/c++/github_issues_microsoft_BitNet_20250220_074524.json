    "body": "I ran your first example, and it knew Mary was in the garden.\n\nThen I tried to ask it a simple question, \"Yes or No, do you know how to write C# code?\"\n\nHere is the answer after I cranked up the token to get more of a response)\n\nAnswer:\nYes or No, do you know how to write C# code? If you do, then you can write C# code for us. If you don\u2019t, then you can learn to write C# code for us. We will pay you by the hour for your C# code.The first step in the process of creating a new product is to identify the need for the product. This is done by conducting a market research study. The market research study is conducted by a marketing research firm. The marketing research firm is a company that specializes in conducting market research.\n\nDid I ask the question wrong, or is this the wrong type of question?\n\nThis project has nearly 10K stars, so I must be the dumb one, but every result I get back is garbage.\n\nMaybe I need to learn more about \"What is this thing supposed to be able to do?\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Again, and again it still returns wrong answers. \n\nQuestion: python run_inference.py -m models/Llama3-8B-1.58-100B-tokens/Llama3-8B-1.58-100B-tokens-TQ1_0-F16.gguf -p \"Kenya is a country in?\\nAnswer:\" -n 6 -temp 0\n\nAnswer: India is a country in Asia\n\nAlso, if I change the initial Mary question even a slightly, it returns pretty senseless answers. It's strange considering the hype on YouTube about BitNet and 1-Bit LLMs or are people pretraining their own custom models perhaps? Am still hopeful."
