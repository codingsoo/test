    "body": "I am implementing the ability to stop scrolling when a particular div reaches the top of the viewable area. The stopScroll function is perfect for this. However, I'm finding it would be nice to have a variable that indicates that scrollToBottom is currently executing so if my component re-renders while it's scrolling to the bottom, it doesn't see that my div is outside the scrollable area and stop the scroll. Essentially being able to do:\r\n\r\n```\r\nif(!scrollingToBottom){\r\n   //do logic for stopping scroll\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis would also be beneficial for skipping certain actions if the component renders and the initial scroll is executing.",
