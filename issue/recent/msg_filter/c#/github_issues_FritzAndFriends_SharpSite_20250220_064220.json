        "body": "Personally, I wouldn't ignore it, but this is a call for @csharpfritz to make.  It would lead to extra work to regenerate. If you delete the file and restart Visual Studio and build the SharpSite.Web project, you'll notice it doesn't automatically add it back. You need to right-click on the .resx file and select `Run Custom Tool` to get it to regenerate. It might be possible to add an MSBuild Target to the `SharpSite.Web.csproj` file to automatically do this and regenerate any that are missing, but it may be easier to just allow the `.Designer.cs` files to be included."

All I did was test adding a new resource and since it automatically added it, I assumed it would do the whole file.\r\n\r\nThen it makes total sense to me to have it in source control."
