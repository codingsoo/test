I mention this because it then ended with other members of the discord attacking me because they perceived me as being impatient and demanding. Those people mean nothing to me so I'm not bothered, but I certainly won't be using the discord server again.\r\n\r\nThis is just to submit that there's an issue that prevented the program from working properly.

I was wondering how long it would take.\r\nI think it would be useful to be able to control the playback speed of the midis; sometimes the player trips over itself if theres too much happening in a song at once. Being able to adjust it could potentially ease the burden on the player when it needs to swap notes frequently, or just make it a more relaxing vibe to match the pace of the game.\r\n/",
