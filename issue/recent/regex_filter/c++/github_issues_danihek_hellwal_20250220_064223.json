Feel free to close this at your convenience. \r\n\r\nHowever, I have a few questions about the project:\r\n1. Is it expected behavior for only one terminal to change color when running hellwal? I've noticed that in ST, only the terminal where I execute the command changes, while other open terminals and newly launched ones don't adopt the new colorscheme.\r\n2. Should I add a hellwal command to my .xinitrc file to ensure it runs on system startup?\r\n3. What other applications can benefit from hellwal? Would DWM or various X11 programs be compatible with it?"

        "body": "Hi, thank you for creating an issue and PR!\r\n\r\n1. Hellwal should color all **currently** open terminals. If you want to have colored every new opened terminal, you have to create template file with colors and source it in ``.bashrc``. I've done it like this:\r\n\r\n(these two hellwal templates are in repo in ``./templates`` folder)\r\n```sh\r\ndh » pwd\r\n/home/dh/.config/hellwal\r\ndh » tree\r\n.\r\n├── templates\r\n│   ├── terminal.sh\r\n│   └── variables.sh\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd in the end of your bashrc put this:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\nsource ~/.cache/hellwal/variables.sh\r\nsh ~/.cache/hellwal/terminal.sh\r\n``` \r\n\r\n2. You don't have to, after running hellwal it's saved to ``~/.cache``, you just have to somehow source or load generated files.\r\n3. A lot, probably anything that can be set through some config file. I use hellwal for Firefox, Terminals, Discord, Duckduckgo, Hyprland, HellWM, Waybar.... There is a lot.\r\n\r\nPS: I already merged **PR**, thank you :) \r\n\r\nAnything else would you like to know about Hellwal or how to use it?"
