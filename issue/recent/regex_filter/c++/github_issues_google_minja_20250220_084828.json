    "body": "Continuation of #37\r\n\r\nSince c73b53f, minja hangs when parsing the template `{#`, e.g.:\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\n#include <minja/minja.hpp>\r\nint main() {\r\n    try {\r\n        minja::Parser::parse(\"{#\", {});\r\n    } catch (...) {\r\n        return 1;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis program should exit with status code 1, but instead it hangs.\r\n\r\nI found a fix that works even with the nonconforming Microsoft STL, and added a test.",
