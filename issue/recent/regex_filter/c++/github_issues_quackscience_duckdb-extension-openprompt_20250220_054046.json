It showed that there were no models.\r\n\r\nSo I tried to find a not-so-large model (~1.3 GB) and ran `ollama pull llama3.2:1b`.  Then ran `ollama list` again to verify it was there.\r\n\r\nUpdated the openprompt_model_name variable with 'llama3.2:1b' and tried again with DuckDB query:  \r\n\r\n`SELECT open_prompt('Write a one-line poem about ducks') AS response;`\r\n\r\n:-)  \r\n\r\n\"With feathers bright as morning dew, they glide serene and slow, their quacks echoing soft as summer snow.\"\r\n\r\nThanks for creating this extension!",
