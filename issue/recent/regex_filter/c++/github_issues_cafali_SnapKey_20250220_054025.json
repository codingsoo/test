    "body": "- Adding a simple random delays produced within a acceptable range seems to not trigger input automation detection systems (E.g CS2). This PR adds a randomly generated delay between key down handles which would look more natural \r\n- The Minimum and Maximum trigger delay in milliseconds can be configured through the `config.cfg` file by adding the line `random_delay_ms=(10,70)` where 10,70 ms is the random delay bounds.\r\n- The above mentioned delay times seems to perform well and does not trigger the detection system. The more you reduce the delay more like you are to get detected. 10,70 ms felt like a sweet spot where 70ms still fast enough switching and won't get detected [until the another detection algorithm cracks this].",

If it were functioning at the hardware level, a new key or shortcut could be introduced to trigger it directly from the keyboard.\r\n\r\nThe only distinction is that it is optimized for the new ultra-fast switches included in their latest keyboards, which helps reduce input latency. SnapKey, on the other hand, is designed to work with any keyboard, even the most basic $5 keyboards.\r\n\r\nRegarding input latency, I personally havenâ€™t noticed any delay while using it, and I lack the means to conduct formal latency benchmarks."
