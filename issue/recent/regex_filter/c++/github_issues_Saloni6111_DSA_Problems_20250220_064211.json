The number 27 is written as XXVII, which is XX + V + II.\r\n\r\nRoman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not IIII. Instead, the number four is written as IV. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as IX. There are six instances where subtraction is used:\r\n\r\nI can be placed before V (5) and X (10) to make 4 and 9. \r\nX can be placed before L (50) and C (100) to make 40 and 90. \r\nC can be placed before D (500) and M (1000) to make 400 and 900.\r\nGiven a roman numeral, convert it to an integer.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nExample 1:\r\n\r\nInput: s = \"III\"\r\nOutput: 3\r\nExplanation: III = 3.",

Understand the Problem:\r\n   - Group words that are anagrams, i.e., strings that can be rearranged to form the same word (e.g., \"eat\" and \"tea\").\r\n\r\n2. Strategy:\r\n   - Use a **character signature** for each word by sorting the characters. Anagrams will have the same sorted result.\r\n   - For each word, sort its characters, then use the sorted word as a key to group the original words in a dictionary.\r\n\r\n3. **Process**:\r\n   - For each word in the input list:\r\n     - Sort the word's characters to create a \"signature\".\r\n     - Group words with the same signature together.\r\n  \r\n4. Output:\r\n   - Collect and return the grouped anagrams from the dictionary as a list of lists.\r\n\r\nThis approach efficiently groups anagrams by utilizing the sorted signature as the key.\r\n\r\nkindly assign this issue to me"
