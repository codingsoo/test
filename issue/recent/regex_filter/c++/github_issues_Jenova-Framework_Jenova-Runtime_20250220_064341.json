        "body": "@ghuser404 Jenova Runtime is fully open-source. It includes everything mentioned in the repository and documentation such as C++ Scripting, Hot-Reloading, Nested Extensions, Addons etc.\n\n### However, You need to understand there is two versions of Jenova Framework :\n- **Open-Source (MIT) Version :** This version includes everything from the proprietary version before it went open-source. ~~Currently at version 0.3.4.7~~, it's designed to be cross-platform but is still not fully functional on Linux (porting state is at 95%)\n- **Proprietary Version :** This version is actively developed and improved by me but it's only available for Windows. Currently at version 0.3.5.7, it is closed-source.\n\n### What's the difference between this two :\n- I develop features and improvements on the Proprietary Version first. If I find time I add these changes to the open-source version. However, there's no guarantee that the open-source version will receive all updates applied to the Proprietary Version. Once the open-source version was released, it's no longer my responsibility, though I contribute to it if time permits. Up until now, I have handled all development tasks myself including the Linux port.\n- Proprietary version comes with some security measurements and code protection features, for obvious reasons those parts cannot be open source and publicized.\n\nSo to make everything clear again, This repository is totally open-source and has complete core functionality. All the black magic happening inside Jenova are present in the open-source repository.\n\n> Are you planning to monetize it?\n\nNot at the moment. Even the Proprietary Version is free for both personal and commercial projects.\n\n\n## New Update : \nOpen-Source repository updated to v0.3.5.7 with all features added to Proprietary version."

I'm unsure if it's a regional issue or related to system locale and I can't fix it since I can't reproduce the issue. \n\nFor now, the best solution is to download and install packages manually. I'm working on an option in Package Manager to install packages from disk."
