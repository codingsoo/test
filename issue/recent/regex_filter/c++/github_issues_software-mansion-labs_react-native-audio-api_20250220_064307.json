    "body": "## Description\nWhen trying to build an Android app that uses react-native-audio-api, the build fails due to a missing FFTW3 library file for the x86_64 architecture.\n\n### Environment\n- react-native-audio-api: ^0.4.2\n- React Native: 0.76.6\n- Android Gradle Plugin: 8.6.0\n- Gradle: 8.10.2\n- Expo: ~52.0.30\n\n### Error Message\nC/C++: ninja: error: '../../../../libs/x86_64/libfftw3.a', needed by '../../../../build/intermediates/cxx/Debug/5q4p5b6z/obj/x86_64/libreact-native-audio-api.so', missing and no known rule to make it\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1. Install react-native-audio-api in a React Native project\n2. Try to build for Android with x86_64 architecture support\n\n### Expected Behavior\nThe project should build successfully with x86_64 architecture support.\n\n### Actual Behavior\nBuild fails due to missing libfftw3.a library for x86_64 architecture.\n\n### Additional Context\nThe error suggests that the FFTW3 library binary for x86_64 architecture is missing from the project's libs directory. This might be an issue with the package distribution or architecture support.\n\n",
