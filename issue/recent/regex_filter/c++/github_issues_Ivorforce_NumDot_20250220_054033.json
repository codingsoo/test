This can be rectified if a `convolve2d` function is exposed by NumDot. \r\n\r\nRegardless, this PR is submitted to serve as a test case to further optimize NumDot calls and until it is fixed, it remains as a warning of the inefficiency of type conversions.\r\n\r\n(Also made some minor changes to the wave equation demo to be more consistent and avoid clashes with other demos.)",
