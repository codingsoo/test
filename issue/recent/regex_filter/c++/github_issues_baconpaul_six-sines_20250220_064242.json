You said the current min that results in the 7.72 hz floor is -70 right? 10 semitones down from there ≈4hz. Jumping from there to 0 isn't gonna cut it. \n\nIf you bring the ratio down to -32 you can almost certainly get there, but having to divide the readouts dividing by 32 is not really great UX. \n\nReally, I think the best solution would be that with keytrack is turned off, the ratio control itself should become a frequency control, ideally fitting 0-100 hz in the first third of a turn or so. Not sure what the param meta data should be but spontaneously the semitone paradigm seems wrong in that case. Though it could work if we figure out how much negative range we actually need for your custom min display to work. \n\nBit annoying streaming-wise obviously, but doable right? "

To save mod assignments, it would be fine for me if decay and release would be modulatable together (like a modulatable decay+release factor). If I had to choose between both, I'd choose only the decay time.\n\n- the modulation target should accept positive and negative modulation values\n- popular use cases\n  - key tracking to envelope decay (especially here the positive/negative mod values come into play) \n  - velocity to envelope decay\n  - continuous (non-switch) sustain pedal to release time (this is not so essential and a bit more esoteric. Current sustain pedal behavior is very fine already)\n",

So far, the accessibility in terms of the labels seems great, but there's a major problem actually getting to the UI.\r\n\r\nQuickest way to reproduce on Mac is just either open the standalone app or add an FX instance in Reaper, then use CTRL+Option+arrows to try navigating to the different controls. What happens right now is VoiceOver, and NVDA on Windows if you use its advanced navigation commands, completely skips over the interface as if it wasn't there. If you click inside the plugin, then start tabbing, then the screen readers due announce the control you're on, but VoiceOver doesn't want to follow the keyboard focus like it normally does. "
