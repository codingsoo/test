    "body": "### Version Number\n\nv0.0.8\n\n### Describe the Issue\n\nSetting the 'center HUD to 16:9' option to false is unusable when playing on 21:9 (3440x1440 in my case) due to zoom in. Minimap/combat HUD elements are cropped, as are the top and bottom of the pause menu. Would it be possible to allow the ingame HUD (minimap/healthbars/button prompts etc.) to be rendered at the correct scale, but positioned correctly at the edges 21:9 (or indeed any custom aspect ratio) for those who prefer not to play with a centered HUD?\n\nAdditionally some submenus such as the confirm prompt when quitting to desktop will no longer appear and game will softlock since you can't confirm nor can you press ESC to back out of the menu. Weirdly it will play audio pings when pressing up/down on the controller as if you're selecting elements but pressing A (or enter on kb) for any of the options does nothing, forcing you to Alt+F4.\n\nIf this is fixed, could the cutscene fix be made indepedent also so you are not forced to use centered HUD. Cheers for the fix otherwise, at least it's completely playable in UW now.\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n\n; Set to true to center the HUD to 16:9.\nEnabled = true\n\nset above to false in the .ini file.\n\nTo reproduce menu softlocking, start game and then try to close game from either main menu or ingame by pressing Esc and selecting 'Quit' option.

I'm interested in back porting this fix to VII Remake as to be honest the Flawless Widescreen version while great for what it does, is extremely lacking compared to your fix and the QOL bonuses it brings (correct movie AF, fixed minigame UI etc) and I love Remake. \n\nI understand the bulk of your code and what fixes you perform to do what you do. I'm a bit lost at how you find the hex patterns to manipulate though. Any way I can pick your brains for 10 mins or so on how you do this and I can get it looked at?\n\nCheers\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n\nN/A\n\n### Log File\n\nN/A\n\n### Save Game (If Relevant)\n\n_No response_",

I married up most of the patterns from the latest Flawless Widescreen's lua script, but obviously I'd of needed to do some hunting for patterns for the movies and mini games (darts and the pressure system in the sewer).
