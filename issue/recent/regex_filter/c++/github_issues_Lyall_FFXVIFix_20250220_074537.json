I have SpecialK enforce a 120 FPS cap to maintain better frametimes.  This works great in gameplay but I noticed ghosting with FG in real-time cutscenes, so I changed the cutscene FG option from true to false.  However, real-time cutscenes are still rendering at 120 FPS per the RTSS overlay and SpecialK.  Oddly, a handful of cutscenes do appear to be rendering at 60 FPS, with the expected drop in GPU utilization.  Unlike the pre-rendered videos, these scenes do not have obvious aliasing and they do not seem particularly intensive graphically.  So, it seems the majority of real-time cutscenes are being rendered at 120 FPS with frame generation while a small subset are rendering at 60 FPS without FG.",

The maker of SpecialK has actually contributed to this fix as well so compatibility should be good. Any conflicting stuff will just fail and let the other software take precedence, like if the framerate stuff was already changed by SpecialK then the pattern scan would fail and move on in FFXVIFix.\r\n"

        "body": "> Not sure what is cause there. Maybe could be due to it being a composite cutscene which they talked about in gdc where they add pre-rendered stuff to dynamically rendered scene (ex-> the opening battle scene between two armies with shiva and titan)\r\n\r\nYou're likely just seeing pre-rendered video as mentioned by Drahsid. \r\n\r\n> That being said; is it possible to also include the ability to select a framerate cap for cutscenes specifically? Something like this;\r\n> \r\n> > [Cutscene Framerate]\r\n> > ; Select Framerate for Cutscenes or Photo Mode (default: 60)\r\n> > CutsceneFramerate = 60\r\n> \r\n> the reason is that the Dynamic Resolution system seems to be based on the targeted in-game framerate. Ideally; prioritizing visual fidelity in cutscene would help-- knowing how demanding the cutscenes can be on low-spec/mid-spec PCs and Steam Deck.\r\n> \r\n> Not only that; it's similar to how Gears 5 approaches its Cinematic framerate cap while giving PC players the option to either set a specific cap or disable it completely.\r\n> \r\n> edit: and a perfect excuse to run cutscenes at 48fps while making a IMAX-style Aspect ratio for the true cinematic experience. :P\r\n\r\nI'd be somewhat hesitant about adding that as an option given most in-game frame limiters tend to be awful. The utility, however, of a per cutscene framerate limit might offset that though. Especially for lower end devices/PCs. All that said, I will look into it and see if I can add it."
