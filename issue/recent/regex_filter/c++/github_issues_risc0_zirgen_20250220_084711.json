Supporting more than 30 bits will add significant complexities. For now we can keep the 2 bytes representation of BC because 2 bytes imply that the input can be approximately 8.5 megabytes (after we add continuations support to the accelerator we can revisit this).\r\n2. We might have another input format that's useful for concurrent invocations (we have an ongoing discussion regarding this), but at least for now this format is good.\r\n\r\nSo the current readme looks good to me as it is."
