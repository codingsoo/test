    "body": "Hi all!\n\nI have seen that when the `transcribe()` method of the `WhisperKitRunner` class is run more than one time, the previous outputs still get shown, like some buffer that hasn't gotten emptied. Is there any cleaning function that should be called between `transcribe()` calls? Is it not thought to be called more than one time?\n\nHere's an example of the issue:\n\n```\nWhisperKitRunner runner(config);\n\n    try {\n        runner.buildPipeline();\n        runner.transcribe();\n        runner.transcribe();\n\n    }\n```\n\nOutput of the SECOND transcribe:\n\n```\nTranscription:   And so my fellow American asked not what your country can do for you   ask what you can do for your country. \n  And so my fellow American asked not what your country can do for you   ask what you can do for your country.\n```\n\nThanks in advance for the help!",

        "body": "I have found that the issue comes from the `all_msgs` vector which is not cleared after transcribing. Is this the expected behavior? I feel like it prevents you from being able to transcribe different files without having to re-create the runner.\n\n```\nstd::unique_ptr<std::string> Runtime::get_result_text() {\n    auto output = make_unique<std::string>(); \n    for (std::vector<std::string>::const_iterator iter = all_msgs.begin(); iter != all_msgs.end(); ++iter){\n        *output += (*iter + '\\n');\n    }\n    return output;\n}\n```\n\nI have added a `all_msgs.clear();` in my code after the for loop which solves the issue. What do you think?"
