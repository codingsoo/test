Details follow.\r\n- Parsing PDFs page-by-page is very fast, but it takes successively longer for every additional page in a document, and the output for page N contains the content of pages 0 to N-1 as well. This also grows memory usage.\r\n- The parser_v2 should accept the loglevel straight at construction time (on `__init__`), so it doesn't spill logs before user code can call `parser.set_loglevel` to silence it.\r\n"
