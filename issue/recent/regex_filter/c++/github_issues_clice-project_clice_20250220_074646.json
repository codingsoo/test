    "body": "## Description\r\nWhen a low-level header file (such as `include/Basic/Location.h`) is modified, it will cause a nearly full compilation of entire project. But in most cases, testing for specific features will be concentrated in one `.cpp` file. Comparing with building the single `.cpp` file to binary, it will take extra unnecessary time to wait for compilation and link to complete.\r\n\r\nIn my machine, a full compilation of clice project takes about 2 minutes while a compilation involving two file changes takes about 20 seconds.\r\n\r\n## Improvements\r\nI propose a new script `scripts/do-single-test.sh` or something like this. It could build and run test for just specific file in `unittest/**/*.cpp`, looks like this:\r\n``` sh\r\n# build test for a module\r\n./scripts/do-singel-test.sh Feature/CodeCompletion.cpp  # build `unittests/Feature/CodeCompletion.cpp` as a executable file \r\n\r\n# run test\r\n./build/bin/Feature-CodeCompletion --test-dir=./tests  --gtest_filter=\"*\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf anyone could help complete this script, it would be greatly appreciated. \r\n",
