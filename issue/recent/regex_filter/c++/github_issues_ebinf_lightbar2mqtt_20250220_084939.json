My wife and I both have light bars, and being able to control them simultaneously from a single NRF24 remote would be incredibly convenient having 2 entities in HA",

From a technical perspective, this is no problem at all (at least for a low number of light bars). I'm just not sure about the exact design. Let me think about an elegant solution."

    "body": "for me the MQTT connection failed with rc=5 (Not authorized) when using the PubSubClient::connect() method. The issue occurred because the wrong method overload was used, omitting the username and password parameters. This led to authentication failure with the MQTT broker. \r\n\r\nI changed it from:\r\nclient.connect(clientId.c_str(), String(mqttRootTopic + \"/\" + clientId + \"/availability\").c_str(), 1, true, \"offline\");\r\n\r\nto:\r\nclient.connect(clientId.c_str(), mqttUser, mqttPassword, String(mqttRootTopic + \"/\" + clientId + \"/availability\").c_str(), 1, true, \"offline\");\r\n\r\nand then it worked for me\r\n\r\nI only found this using chatgpt tbh \r\n",
