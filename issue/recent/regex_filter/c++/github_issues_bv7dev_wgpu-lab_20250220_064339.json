Probably it's some variable we have to define for the dawn build or something like that."

The problem I see is that once you have it as a submodule, it's very difficult to change it later.\r\nAt least I had my trouble with submodules in the past.\r\n\r\nIf we had a simple script to automatically manage dependencies for us, it would be better in my opinion."
