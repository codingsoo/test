    "body": "Draft of Progress Capture. \r\n\r\nIntent was to build on existing Logging System and provide a convenient way to produce rich display of progress events. Design should be simple to be able to add/filter scopes, add/easily enrich UX/progress display mechanisms and later use \"Progress\" log event types for high volume ephemeral comms.\r\n\r\nMain changes:\r\n\r\n - File Logger saves in JSONL format\r\n - Secrets are obscured by the JSON serializer unless environment variable overrides\r\n - Addition of ProgressLogger which captures the log event stream to convert log events to progress info\r\n - Addition of contextual data to important log events for progress reporting\r\n - Rudimentary formatter for progress events (on by default, can be switched off with config option `progress_display=False`)\r\n - Offline summarizer, viewer, rich progress stimulator for further development and testing of display.\r\n\r\nFuture enhancements could include\r\n - Use of \"Progress\" log events specifically to capture ephemeral high volume status updates (e.g. token streaming, MCP notifications). \r\n - Abstractions in the augmented_llm areas etc. to avoid duplication of intent. Better use of constants/common methods to allow identification of important progress events.\r\n - Console redirection and better use of Rich to make it more visually appealing.\r\n - Better display of intent (e.g. Agent Call vs. Assistant Call) for Chatting.\r\n \r\n",
