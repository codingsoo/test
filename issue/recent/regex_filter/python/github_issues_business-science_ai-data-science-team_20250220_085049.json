        "body": "Sorry for the late reply. Say the format of phone numbers are different after the first 100 rows. Incase we deal with phone numbers with different country codes. We should be able to standardise that. Some values may be +1 ...... or just their phone numbers. This is hard to figure out when only the first 100 rows are used as a sample. We need to chunk the table and pass it into the LLM. And if we are keen on data security we shouldn't use the gpt api, as they train their models using the data they receive from their customers."
