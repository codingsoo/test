    "body": "# What does this PR do?\r\n\r\n1. For best security practices HF_TOKEN should be first pulled out from the environment and maybe then from configuration file, this PR ensures it.\r\n2. Model download is handled manually. This PR relies on `huggingface_hub` lib to download the model using `hf_transfer` simplifying the current process.\r\n",
