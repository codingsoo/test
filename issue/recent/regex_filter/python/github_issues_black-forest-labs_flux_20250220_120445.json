The true_gs parameter does not exist in the flux code of BFL.\r\nI'll leave this question for people who have the same doubts. \r\nIn the BFL code, this guidance is actually CFG, but when distilling the model, it is turned into an embedding to learn the result of the teacher model adjusting the CFG parameters. Therefore, after the distillation is completed, that is, in the inference of flux-dev, it is not necessary to use CFG inferencing twice (conditional and unconditional) to get the result, thereby speeding up the entire inferencing process.\r\nAt the same time, the x-flux code changed true_gs from 4 to 1 in one submission, which should be the reason."

    "body": "### Issue Addressed:\r\n\r\nThe `prepare` function previously faced challenges with mismatched numbers of prompts and images. This issue was particularly evident when multiple prompts were associated with a single image, leading to inconsistent batch sizes and potential runtime errors. The original function lacked sufficient mechanisms for aligning image and text data properly, which could result in misaligned processing inputs.\r\n\r\n### Implemented Fixes:\r\n\r\n##### 1. Automatic Image Replication: \r\nEnhanced the function to automatically replicate images when multiple prompts are provided with fewer images. This ensures that each prompt is paired with an image, preventing mismatches and potential processing errors.\r\nError Handling for Mismatched Inputs: Introduced error checks that trigger if the number of prompts and images do not align when multiple images are provided. This preemptive check prevents confusing errors deeper in the processing pipeline.\r\n\r\n##### 2. Text Processing: \r\nStrengthened text handling by ensuring text embeddings are consistently replicated across the calculated batch size. This change guarantees that each image in a batch is paired with corresponding text data, which is crucial for models leveraging both visual and textual inputs.\r\n\r\n\r\n##### 3. Tensor Consistency: \r\nImproved the handling of tensor device and data type settings, ensuring all tensors involved in the computation are consistently configured. This uniformity is key for avoiding device-related errors and optimizing computational efficiency.\r\n\r\nThese enhancements make the function more reliable and user-friendly, streamlining the handling of batch sizes and prompt associations, and reducing the risk of runtime errors in your data processing workflow.\r\n\r\n",

Depending on the initial implementation, you may see that the function doesn’t handle the replication of the single image across multiple prompts correctly, which would typically lead to a runtime error or sometimes incorrect data processing."

Feel free to add it to all too.\r\n\r\nDone!\r\n\r\n> If you take the seed of a previous calculation and pass it through the demo again you will get a different output. If you generate another time afterwards it will give you the same image again. I'm assuming that gradio has an internal representation of that seed as a float somewhere in the middle and loses precision. This should be fixed.\r\n\r\nI found the issue. The issue is that the seed is normally calculated in Python, however when passed to the Javascript front-end, Gradio uses Javascript's `Number`, which has a maximum value of `2^53 - 1` or `9007199254740992` so if the seed is larger than that, it will replace the extra characters with zeroes 😅. The workaround I did is to do `str` in Javascript but convert to `int` for Python that can handle the larger numbers."
