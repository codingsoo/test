Thanks for your explanation.\r\n> \r\n> All I can say is that I don't experience issues with speed, so there shouldn't be anything inherently slower. Settings can work differently as ai-toolkit is somewhat different from kohya.我只能说我没有遇到速度问题，所以本来就不应该有任何变慢的事情。设置的工作方式可能有所不同，因为 ai-toolkit 与 kohya 有些不同。\r\n> \r\n> The question is fine, I'd just like more information as I have no reference point to what the speed you should expect with this is. 5 s/it does sound way too slow and I have not experienced anything like that with 4090.这个问题很好，我只是想要更多信息，因为我没有参考点来说明您应该期望的速度是多少。5 秒/它听起来确实太慢了，我还没有遇到过 4090 这样的事情。\r\n\r\nAccording to my verification, there are several points that make the training time different\r\nAitoolkit uses multiple resolutions for training by default, while I usually only use 1024-based resolutions on comfyui, which causes a speed difference of about 2x\r\nThe size of the image footage is particularly critical to the speed. At first, I used the short-sided 1024 logic for batch processing of the footage by default, which made the footage 1-2 times larger than the total pixels of the 1024 image, and the training time more than doubled\r\nThe adam8bit used by aitoolkit by default is also a faster option than the prodigy I use in comfyui. Of course, this has less impact than the above two points."
