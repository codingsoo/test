Recommendation Engine: SuggestArr generates recommendations by analyzing the viewing history of all users on the media server. For each user, it retrieves recently viewed content to suggest similar media. Currently, user ratings aren’t factored into the recommendation process, but this could be a future enhancement.\r\n2. HTTPS Support for Plex: At the moment, SuggestArr supports only HTTP connections for Plex. However, HTTPS support is on my roadmap. I plan to investigate further to identify the cause behind the current SSL limitation for Plex connections.\r\n3.  Configuration Management: I’m glad you appreciate the step-by-step setup interface! I'm already working on making the configuration more flexible, allowing users to adjust individual settings without needing to restart the entire setup process.\r\n\r\nThank you again for the feedback, and I hope you're enjoying SuggestArr!

Each user may have different tastes, so one recommendation engine isn't a good match (among other reasons). Also, could the current behavior explain the duplicate recommendations from #74 ? I also experienced this and wasn't sure why, but if SuggestArr pulls viewing history for each user individually and makes recommendations, then if two users have similar tastes it may recommend the same item? Obviously if it combines viewing history from all users before attempting to create issues then that would not explain #74.\r\n\r\nThanks for all the replies - and truly, this is an awesome app. This feature (automatic recommendations based on watch history) is a major gap with a self-hosted server. Definitely exciting!"

Implementing a way to filter recommendations based on user preferences or specific user histories would indeed help tailor the results better.\r\n\r\nTo clarify, SuggestArr is designed to check for existing requests before creating a new one, so theoretically, it should avoid duplicates even if multiple users have similar watch histories. However, it seems that in some cases this doesn’t work as expected, which could lead to duplicate recommendations.\r\n\r\nI’ll need to investigate why the duplicate check isn’t always catching these cases.

I've looked into it, and while I couldn’t find a way to request just a single episode via Overseer, I’ve added a feature to control the number of seasons requested. You’ll now see a new input field where you can specify the number of seasons to monitor:\r\n\r\n- Leaving it blank will request all available seasons.\r\n- Entering \"1\" will monitor only the first season.\r\n- Entering \"3\" will monitor the first three seasons.\r\n\r\nThis should give more flexibility over how much content is initially requested. What do you think? If you’re available, I’d really appreciate your help testing this on the `nightly` tag!\r\n\r\nThanks again for your support!"

Currently, SuggestArr doesn’t automatically add the next season after a user watches the season, but it’s a great idea. Tracking watched progress or monitoring upcoming seasons could be valuable features. Could you open a new issue for this? It’ll help track the discussion and any future development.\n"

It's very hard to indicate if the script is working without looking at the repository and the Dockerfile to figure out it's cron based.\r\n\r\nIt may also be worth making it an option to be able to have the script run initially on container start and give people the ability to enable/disable this via an environment variable, as some might like to use docker scripts externally to restart at very bespoke cron timings. \r\n\r\nI also suggest making some type of initialisation message too, as people adding this from the unraid store will not have much context as to why things aren't working and believe the app is broken as there is no ouput.

A web interface has been implemented to enhance the management of the automation process. Users can now specify a custom cron schedule either through environment variables or directly via the front-end interface, providing greater flexibility in how the script operates.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I've added a \"Force Run\" button on the web page, allowing users to manually initiate the process after setting the environment variables. This feature offers more control over the automation workflow.\r\n\r\nLooking ahead, I also plan to implement a welcome message in the terminal output. This will provide users with clear feedback on the script's execution status, helping to clarify any potential confusion regarding its operation.\r\n\r\nI appreciate your input and am committed to making the project as user-friendly as possible. If you have any more ideas or questions, feel free to reach out!"
