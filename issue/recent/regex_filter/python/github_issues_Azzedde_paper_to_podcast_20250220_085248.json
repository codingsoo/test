        "body": "**Hello Mohcene,**\r\n\r\nThank you for your interest in the project! I appreciate your question regarding the API key setup, as I didnâ€™t go into much detail in the documentation about adding it to the `.env` file to ensure the project runs seamlessly.\r\n\r\nAs you may know, LLMs (Large Language Models) are complex neural networks that require significant computational resources to operate efficiently. While itâ€™s possible to run an LLM on a CPU, it can be extremely slow. Thankfully, providers like OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google offer powerful LLMs accessible via their platforms. By subscribing to their services, you gain access through an API key. This key acts as a credential to authenticate your requests and ensure secure communication between you (the client) and the provider.\r\n\r\nI recommend visiting the OpenAI website (or the relevant provider) to explore their guides and pricing models. Most providers offer free credits when you create an account, allowing you to test the project without any initial cost. However, once these free credits are depleted, youâ€™ll need to pay to continue using their services.\r\n\r\nTo integrate your API key into the project, follow these steps:\r\n\r\n1. Clone the repository.\r\n2. In the projectâ€™s root directory, create a file named `.env`.\r\n3. Add your API key in the following format:\r\n\r\n   ```plaintext\r\n   OPENAI_API_KEY=\"sk-123...\"\r\n   ```\r\n\r\nOnce this is done, the project should function smoothly.\r\n\r\nThanks again for reaching out! Donâ€™t hesitate to ask if you encounter any other issuesâ€”Iâ€™m happy to help.\r\n\r\nBest regards,  \r\nAzzedine\r\n"
