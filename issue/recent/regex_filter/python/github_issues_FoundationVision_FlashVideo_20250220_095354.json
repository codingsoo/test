Is it because a file was uploaded missing?",

Here, `sat` points to the module in the environment, corresponding to `SwissArmyTransformer>=0.4.12` in the requirements. Have you executed `pip install -r requirements`? Feel free to comment here if you continue to face issues.\n\nTo avoid this confusion for more people, I may consider renaming the folder to `flashvideo`. Thanks for your feedback"
