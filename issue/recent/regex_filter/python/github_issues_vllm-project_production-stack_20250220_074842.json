We will incorporate more routing logic in the future. \n\nIf you want to have your customized routing logic, feel free to extend the `RoutingInterface` class defined in `routing_logic.py`. The main routing function takes in the available endpoints, engine statistics, query-level statistics, and the request itself as the input, and returns the target URL as the output. So should be highly customizable"

Maybe we could give it a try?\n\n\n",
