        "body": "I dont think that is easily done because the BAP mesages have different parameters. But you can see the BAP messages which can be sent from the MIB in the lsd.jxe in the package `de.vw.mib.bap.mqbab2.audiosd.functions`, `de.vw.mib.bap.mqbab2.navsd.functions` and `de.vw.mib.bap.mqbab2.telephone2.functions`.\r\n\r\nI also tried a bit to find something tho show messages in the VC. the only thing I found was to use `ASLNavBAPFactory.getNavBAPApi().updateBapTMCInfo()` to send a message to VC. The issue I had was that every time a message is sent the dashboard does a chime. Which is quite annoying if the message is not critical.\r\n\r\nI think ideal would be if it is somehow possible to put a message in the little popup which is uses e.g. when the drive mode is changed."
