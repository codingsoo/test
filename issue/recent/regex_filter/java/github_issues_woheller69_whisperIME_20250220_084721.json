In contrast, Futo is recognized if I push the microphone symbol in Anysoftkeybord. Thus, it might basically work too. I don't know if I am doing any setting wrong.\n\nTo be precise: Choosing whisperIME as keyboard works perfectly. Invoking whisperIME via Anysoftkeyboard does currently not work. I haven't tested other keyboards.\n\nMaybe you would like to take a look at this in the future.\n\nThanks",

Press and hold the push-to-talk button\n2. Speak for a few seconds\n3. Release the button (speech processing starts)\n4. While it's still processing, press the button again to start a new recording\n→ App crashes\n\n**Additional Note:**\nI also noticed the same 30-second limitation mentioned in issue #10 (speech beyond ~30 seconds gets lost without any notification). Just mentioning it here as additional feedback.\n\n---\n\nI'm happy to provide any additional information that might help debug this issue. Just let me know if you need anything else!

    "body": "Hi there! \r\n\r\nAmazing app, it's great to finally have a working offline alternative for voice recognition on Android!\r\n\r\nI was wondering if it would be possible to add a feature to import existing audio files? \r\n\r\nIt would be handy for:\r\n- Transcribing voice messages received on WhatsApp/Telegram/etc.\r\n- Processing previously recorded voice memos  \r\n- And many other similar use cases\r\n\r\nI know this isn't the main purpose of the app which is more IME-focused, but it could be a nice bonus feature for users.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?\r\n\r\nThanks!",

For example, the screen readers cannot read the element names in the UI because they are not properly labeled. Please label them according to the Android accessibility guidelines. Also, there should be some kind of feedback to let us know that the recording has been started. I would like to thank you for this project and hope that it keeps growing. ",
