    "body": "Describe what this PR does / why we need it:\r\n\r\nThis pull request addresses identified design smells in the codebase and implements refactoring techniques to enhance the maintainability, modularity, and reusability of the code. Specifically, the changes improve code structure by extracting and encapsulating logic, thereby reducing duplication and improving overall code quality.\r\n\r\nDoes this pull request fix one issue?\r\nNONE\r\n\r\nDescribe how you did it:\r\n\r\nPull-Up Method: Moved shared functionalities from dependent classes to a higher-level class. This ensures the functionality is reusable and avoids redundant code duplication. Other classes now simply call the centralized methods.\r\n\r\nExtract Method: Isolated specific retry logic from the original class and shifted it into a dedicated class. This approach simplifies the original class by abstracting reusable functionalities into separate methods, making the code more modular and easier to maintain.\r\n\r\nDescribe how to verify it:\r\n\r\n1. Compiled it to check there is no formatting issues, and to check the build status.\r\n2. Verified the changes by running all existing test cases to ensure no functionality is broken.\r\n\r\nSpecial notes for reviews\r\n\r\nThis code refactor aims to enhance readability, maintainability, and modularity without altering the core logic. Feedback on the clarity of these changes and their alignment with best practices is highly appreciated.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, these modifications align with project standards and may serve as a basis for further improvements. Any suggestions for optimizing the variable naming, refactored functions, or memory handling logic would be particularly valuable.",
