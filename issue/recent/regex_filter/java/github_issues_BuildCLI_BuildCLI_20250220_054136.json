    "body": "**Description:**  \nCurrently, BuildCLI does not perform an environment validation before executing commands, which can lead to unexpected failures due to missing or misconfigured dependencies. To ensure a seamless development experience and prevent execution issues, the CLI must verify the presence and versions of critical tools and dependencies, including:  \n\n- **JDKs** (List available versions and detect the active one)  \n- **Maven** (Check installation and version)  \n- **Gradle** (Check installation and version)  \n- **Docker** (Ensure it is installed and running)  \n\n### **Why is this crucial?**  \n- Running a project without the required tools can result in build failures and inconsistent behavior.  \n- Some commands, such as `project code document`, rely on specific dependencies, and missing them leads to unnecessary debugging time.  \n- Users may not always be aware of configuration issues in their environment, making troubleshooting difficult.  \n\n### **Proposed Solution**  \nIntroduce a `doctor` command to diagnose and resolve environment issues efficiently:  \n\n1. **`doctor scan`** ‚Äì Scans the system for missing or misconfigured dependencies and provides a detailed report.  \n2. **`doctor fix`** ‚Äì Attempts to automatically resolve detected issues, such as setting the correct JDK version or providing installation guidance for missing tools.  \n\n### **Expected Behavior**  \n- If an essential tool is missing, the CLI should provide clear installation instructions.  \n- If a version mismatch is detected, the CLI should suggest corrective actions.  \n- If Docker is installed but not running, the CLI should notify the user and suggest restarting it.  \n\nBy implementing this, we significantly enhance the reliability of BuildCLI, ensuring developers can focus on coding instead of dealing with environment-related issues.

Always use the `develop` branch for your PRs. Now it's corrected.\"\n\n### Expected Outcome:\n- PRs from external contributors are directed to the correct branch (`develop`).\n- Contributors receive clear and friendly guidance.\n- Maintainers spend less time managing misdirected PRs.\n\nThis should be a simple automation that enhances the contribution process while keeping our workflow organized.\n\nLet's implement this and track the progress!\n\n",

    "body": "**Description:**  \nCurrently, the `project run` command executes only the main project. This enhancement aims to extend its functionality to also support running standalone `.jar` and `.java` files.  \n\n### **Proposed Changes:**  \n- Allow `project run` to accept a `.jar` file as an argument and execute it.  \n- Enable `project run` to compile and run a `.java` file directly.  \n- Add appropriate error handling and validations for file existence and execution context.  \n- Update the documentation to reflect these new capabilities.  \n\n### **Example Usage:**  \n```sh\nproject run my-app.jar     # Runs the specified .jar file  \nproject run Main.java      # Compiles and runs the specified .java file  \nproject run                # Runs the main project as usual  \n```\n\n### **Benefits:**  \n- Provides more flexibility for users running Java applications.  \n- Reduces the need for manual compilation and execution steps.  \n- Enhances usability by supporting common Java execution workflows.  \n\n### **Additional Notes:**  \nAny suggestions or improvements to the implementation approach are welcome! üöÄ",

You‚Äôre welcome to take issues that haven‚Äôt been updated recently, even if they‚Äôre assigned, but I kindly suggest asking in cases where the assignment is recent.

To improve the user experience and centralize all tool-related information, we propose creating an official web page for BuildCLI. This page will include:\n\n- **Complete Documentation:**\n  - Installation and configuration guides\n  - Usage examples and command references\n  - Tutorials and FAQs\n  - Troubleshooting tips and solutions for common issues\n\n- **Latest Version Details and CHANGELOG:**\n  - An up-to-date CHANGELOG detailing all changes and updates\n  - Information on new features and bug fixes\n  - Links to version comparisons and release notes\n\n- **Additional Resources:**\n  - Integration with the repository (e.g., GitHub) for quick access to source code, issue tracking, and pull request submissions\n  - Contact details and links for community support\n  - Optionally, a blog or news section for major updates and announcements\n\n## Motivation\n\nCreating this web page aims to:\n\n- **Centralize Information:**  \n  Provide a single source of truth where users can quickly access all relevant details about BuildCLI.\n\n- **Improve Communication:**  \n  Serve as the official channel for disseminating updates, bug fixes, and new feature announcements.\n\n- **Encourage Community Contributions:**  \n  A well-organized documentation platform will make it easier for the community to contribute, provide feedback, and collaborate on improvements.\n\n- **Ensure Consistency:**  \n  Maintain up-to-date documentation and a consistent user experience across all platforms and versions.\n\n## Technical Requirements and Considerations\n\n1. **Responsive Design:**\n   - The web page should be optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.\n   - It should feature a clean, intuitive interface with straightforward navigation.\n\n2. **Tools and Technologies:**\n   - Evaluate integration with CI/CD pipelines to automatically sync the CHANGELOG and documentation from the repository.\n   - **Deployment Option:** The page can be hosted on GitHub Pages, providing a straightforward and efficient solution for deployment and maintenance.\n\n3. **Content Organization:**\n   - Define clear sections such as Documentation, Versions, Installation, and Support.\n   - Implement a search functionality to help users quickly locate specific topics or information.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nCreating an official web page for BuildCLI is a strategic step toward centralizing the tool‚Äôs documentation, version details, and support information. This initiative will enhance user experience, streamline internal processes, and encourage community involvement. Utilizing GitHub Pages for hosting further simplifies deployment and maintenance, ensuring that both current and future users have a reliable resource to maximize their experience with BuildCLI.",

    "body": "### **Description:**  \nCurrently, BuildCLI relies on a **local Ollama API** to enable AI-powered features, requiring users to manually run an additional server (`ollama run llama3.2`). While this approach works, it introduces performance overhead and an extra setup step for users.  \n\nTo improve both **performance** and **user experience (UX)**, we should consider replacing Ollama with **JLama or another Java-based AI framework**. This change would allow BuildCLI to handle AI features natively without requiring external dependencies, simplifying the setup process for users.  \n\n### **Potential Benefits:**  \n‚úÖ **Better Performance** ‚Äì A Java-native AI solution could integrate more efficiently with BuildCLI.  \n‚úÖ **Seamless User Experience** ‚Äì Users wouldn‚Äôt need to manually start or manage an external AI server.  \n‚úÖ **Future AI Expansions** ‚Äì This could be the foundation for further improvements and AI-driven enhancements in BuildCLI.  \n‚úÖ **Customizable AI Behavior** ‚Äì Allow developers to configure:  \n   - Whether the AI **context** should persist between executions in a feature.  \n   - The **model size** used for processing, optimizing for speed or accuracy.  \n\n### **Technical Implementation:**  \n1. **Replace Ollama Integration in `--document-code`**  \n   - Refactor the current implementation to use **JLama** (or another Java-native AI framework).  \n   - Ensure the new implementation preserves existing functionalities while improving performance.  \n\n2. **Create a Reusable AI Processing Module**  \n   - Implement a **generic AI service** that can be extended for future AI-based features.  \n   - This module should:  \n     - Accept text input and return AI-generated responses.  \n     - Support **configurable context management** (persistent or stateless).  \n     - Allow users to select **different AI model sizes** based on their needs.  \n\n### **Next Steps:**  \n- Investigate **JLama** or other Java-native AI frameworks for integration.  \n- Implement the new AI processing system, ensuring feature parity with the existing Ollama-based implementation.  \n- Validate the integration with `--document-code` and prepare for future AI-powered features.  \n\nWould love to hear thoughts from the community! üöÄ  ",
