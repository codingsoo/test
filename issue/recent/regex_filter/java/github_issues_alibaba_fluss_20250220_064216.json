So we don't need to introduce a map cache for it.\r\n\r\nBesides, the `GatewayClientProxy` holds a `ServerNode` supplier, because the bucket leader server may change, and the supplier makes `GatewayClientProxy` resilient to changes in the cluster topology by dynamically providing the updated ServerNode instance. This ensures that the `GatewayClientProxy` always interacts with the current leader server for the bucket, thereby maintaining consistent and efficient communication even if the leadership or server configuration shifts. However, the caching mechanism forces `GatewayClientProxy` to bind a static `ServerNode`. So caching breaks resilience to changes in the cluster topology.\r\n\r\nWe do need some improvement around `GatewayClientProxy` to reduce the re-creation. But we need some design first. "
