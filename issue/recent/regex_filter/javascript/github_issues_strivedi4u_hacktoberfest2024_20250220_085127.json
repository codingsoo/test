    "body": "A \"Memory Block\" game, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, is a classic matching game where players must flip over pairs of blocks to reveal hidden images, aiming to find matching pairs by memory alone. The game typically features a grid of blocks, each initially displaying a blank face, and the player clicks on blocks to flip them over, revealing an image underneath. If the two flipped blocks match, they stay revealed; if not, they flip back over, and the player continues clicking to find more pairs.",

This algorithm efficiently calculates the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray by iterating through the input array only once. It maintains two variables: res to store the maximum sum found so far and currSum to track the current subarray's sum. As it iterates through the array, currSum is updated by adding the current element. If currSum exceeds res, it updates res. If currSum falls below zero, it is reset to zero, effectively starting a new subarray. This approach ensures optimal performance with a time complexity of O(n).",
