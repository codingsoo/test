This is the reason I put this toggle, to let the user decide. \r\n\r\nHowever, a better idea could be to maybe place in in the end?

        "body": "Good morning, everyone!\r\nI've not yet reviewed the PR changes thoroughly, but let's talk about a couple of things:\r\n- Shoutout to @Perseus333 for trying out new things! And shoutout to @Myouboku for keeping an eye on the project! You're both killing it!\r\n- This one is a hard feature to ship, and we got to fully understand the nuances of implementing something like this. We'll need some data and comparisons to properly conclude about the way we're doing this (hiding vs. removing vs. preventing from loading).\r\n- Hiding elements means they keep loading in the background (check the next example); How's the case when we're removing them from the DOM? Are they being added again? Are the requests for those elements still being done in the background? Or is the request done when loading the page in the first place (this is probably not the case)?\r\n  - Consider the following scenario: I'm using TubeMod and decided to hide suggested videos. When I'm scrolling through the comments, what happens in the background if I have them hidden? What if I have them removed?Â \r\n  - To raise some conclusions about the benefits of removing elements vs. simply hiding them, here's an idea: Use the same video and the same starting point, which should be the initial page load. Pause the video, let it load up to the point where the play bar stops progressing, and start testing by hiding the suggested videos and scrolling to the bottom of the comments. How long did it take? What does the network tab say about the loading speed? Repeat the same process when deleting the suggested videos. This isn't perfect (the internet speed and the machine performance are variables), but it should allow us to reach some conclusions.\r\n- Another possible approach (and possibly more demanding; therefore, out of the scope of this PR) would be preventing the requests from being done in the first place. If requests are blocked, there's less resources being retrieved, which means the page would be ready faster.\r\n- Removing elements should 100% be an option for users to toggle or simply check, for one simple reason: it changes the way they interact with YouTube. TubeMod hides things, which means we can bring them back at any time because they are already there, just hidden. Removing content means the DOM is updated, and to bring them back, users need to reload the page, changing how they interact with both the extension and YouTube itself.\r\n- Removing elements is something only a small number of users would use, I believe. Therefore, I also think this should be under an advanced section in the popup. We may also be starting to need a proper settings page, given the amount of things we have to hide (again, this is out of scope of this PR; don't worry about it) ðŸ˜† \r\n\r\nNevertheless, thank you both for talking about stuff and bringing news ideias to the table. Also, please, don't take anything that I said as an universal truth, remember I'm still learning as well! These were just my two cents on what we're talking about :)"

I know that this is because of the generic selector (which I will fix) but this shouldn't happen anyways. Due to the attribute(?): `pageTypes: [PAGE_TYPES.HOME],` it should only apply to the homepage and not the subscriptions. Maybe there is an issue with the handling of that?\r\n\r\n(1 hour later)\r\n\r\nI have found that the issue probably lies in that the eventListener `yt-navigate-finish` doesn't trigger when you go back to a cached(?) page.

I have tried several others like:\r\n- yt-navigate-cache\r\n- track\r\n- transitioned\r\n- load\r\n\r\nAnd every single time nothing changes. @Pedro-Gregorio, if you know what could be the source of the issue tell me because right now I'm lost."
