Explain the problem that you are solving and provide the\r\nnecessary context.\r\n\r\nThe Problem was, that if you connect to a SSH-Server which has needs a Second-Authentication-Step with the keyboard-interactive Authentication-Method, the Connection will be closed with the Error \"all Authentication Methods failed\". To fix fix of this Problem is to improve the handling of the keyboard-interactive Event in the ssh2-package. So that the Server will receive the keyboard-interactive Event from the ssh2-npm-package, and if this asks after a Google-Authenticator-TOTP-Code, it sends a Message via the Websocket to the Client(The Frontend), that will prompt to the user to enter the TOTP-Code which will be sended after pressing enter back to the server.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or if i should change anything, feel free to write me. Also for any Improvements and Bugfixes i am happy to hear from you.\r\n\r\n## üöÄ Changes made to ...\r\n\r\n- [x] üîß Server\r\n- [x] üñ•Ô∏è Client\r\n- [ ] üìö Documentation\r\n- [ ] üîÑ Other: ___\r\n\r\n## ‚úÖ Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] My code follows the style guidelines of this project\r\n- [x] I have performed a self-review of my own code\r\n- [x] I have looked for similar pull requests in the repository and found none\r\n\r\n## üîó Related Issues <!-- If there are any related issues, please link them here. -->\r\n\r\nFixes #66 \r\n",
