Please assign this issue to me and let's make this project more engaging.\r\n\r\nLooking forward to your thoughts!\r\n\r\nBest,  \r\n[Dhruv Davda]\r\n",

Critical operations such as adding, editing, deleting tasks, local storage interactions, and updating the displayed todo list are now enclosed in try...catch blocks. This ensures the application gracefully handles errors and provides clear feedback to the user.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, validation checks are included to prevent the creation of tasks without all required fields. The goal is to improve reliability and prevent potential crashes during user interactions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Type of change\r\n\r\nPlease delete options that are not relevant.\r\n\r\n- [ X] Bug fix (non-breaking change)\r\n\r\n## How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nPlease describe the tests that you ran to verify your changes. Provide instructions so that they can be reproduced.\r\n\r\nTests were conducted to verify the functionality of the todo list with the added error handling. The following tests were performed:\r\n\r\n- [ X] Test A: Add a new task with valid inputs to confirm correct creation and storage.\r\n- [ X] Test B: Attempt to add a task with incomplete inputs to ensure validation messages are displayed.\r\n- [ X]  Test C: Edit a task and verify that the updates are reflected correctly in the UI and local storage.\r\n- [ X]  Test D: Delete a task and check that it is removed from both the UI and local storage.\r\n- [ X]  Test E: Simulate a localStorage failure to ensure graceful handling of errors.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Checklist:\r\n\r\n- [ X] My code follows the style guidelines of this project\r\n- [ X] I have performed a self-review of my code\r\n- [ X] I have commented my code, particularly in hard-to-understand areas\r\n- [ X] I have made corresponding changes to the documentation\r\n- [ X] My changes generate no new warnings\r\n- [ X] Any dependent changes have been merged and published in downstream modules\r\n",

    "body": "This PR enhances the functionality of the Todo List application by adding support for triggering both task addition and task updates via the \"Enter\" key, improving the overall user experience. Previously, users had to manually click the \"Add\" or \"Update\" buttons to add or edit tasks. Now, pressing the \"Enter\" key while entering a task or editing an existing task will perform the corresponding action automatically. \r\n\r\n#### **Changes Made:**\r\n- **Enter Key Functionality:**\r\n  - Implemented key event listeners for the \"Enter\" key across the task input fields.\r\n  - Users can now press \"Enter\" to:\r\n    - Add a new task when not in edit mode.\r\n    - Update an existing task when in edit mode.\r\n  \r\n- **Task Editing Workflow:**\r\n  - Added a flag (`isEditing`) to track whether the user is in \"add\" or \"edit\" mode.\r\n  - Stored the index of the task being edited (`editingIndex`) to ensure the correct task is updated.\r\n  - Automatically switch between \"Add\" and \"Update\" buttons based on the current mode (task addition or editing).\r\n\r\n- **UX Enhancement:**\r\n  - The input fields are now more responsive, and task management is smoother.\r\n  - Minor tweaks to the layout and styling were made for better consistency.\r\n\r\n#### **Issue Link:**\r\nCloses #18  â Add \"Enter Key\" Functionality to Trigger Task Submission\r\n\r\n#### **Additional Notes:**\r\nPlease add the **Hacktoberfest** label to this PR as part of the Hacktoberfest initiative, so it can be counted towards contributions for participants. \r\n\r\n",
