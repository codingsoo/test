    "body": "Prior to merging in #9, typescript would automatically detect that the types for the entrypoint `src/main-prod.js` were found in the corresponding type declaration file `types/main-prod.d.ts`.\r\n\r\nSince the entrypoint has changed to `dist/PhaserBox2D.js`, the type declaration entrypoint must also be explicitly set (- otherwise typescript can't find the correct matching declaration file).\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes this issue. Cheers.",

Looking at `package.json` it's got `\"main\": \"index.js\"`  Should this instead be something like `\"main\": \"dist/PhaserBox2D.js\"` ?\r\n\r\nIt's unintuitive, having to write:\r\n```javascript\r\nimport * as Box2D from 'phaser-box2d/dist/PhaserBox2D.js'\r\n```",
