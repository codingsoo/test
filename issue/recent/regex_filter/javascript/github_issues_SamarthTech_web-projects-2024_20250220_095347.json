The timer dynamically switches between work and break intervals based on user input.\r\n  \r\n- **3D Components with Three.js:**  \r\n  Introduced dynamic 3D components using the Three.js library to enhance the visual experience. The 3D components adjust based on timer progress, creating a more interactive and engaging user interface.\r\n  \r\n- **Responsive Design:**  \r\n  Ensured that the design is fully responsive and works seamlessly across devices (desktop, tablet, and mobile).\r\n\r\n- **State Management:**  \r\n  Utilized React's useState and useEffect hooks to manage the timer's state efficiently. The 3D elements also interact with the timer state, providing real-time feedback.\r\n\r\n- **Performance Optimization:**  \r\n  Improved performance by optimizing the rendering of 3D components, ensuring smooth transitions and animations.\r\n\r\n### Changes:\r\n\r\n- Added a Pomodoro timer component with customizable work/break intervals.\r\n- Integrated Three.js to create dynamic, animated 3D elements.\r\n- Established communication between the timer state and the 3D components to create a synchronized, real-time experience.\r\n- Ensured that the layout is responsive and optimized for different screen sizes.\r\n- Refactored code for better readability and performance.\r\n\r\n### Testing:\r\n\r\n- Manually tested the timer functionality and 3D interactions on various devices and browsers.\r\n- Verified responsiveness across screen sizes.\r\n- Checked for smooth performance with the 3D elements under different user interactions.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n",
