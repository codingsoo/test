Start the dev mode with 'npm run dev'. Then modify app entry file, the vite build tool could not build automatic after app entry file modified.\n\n### What is expected?\n\ncreate a simple demo, with new a app entry file 'app.ts'. Start the dev mode with 'npm run dev'. Then modify app entry file, the vite build tool could build automatic after app entry file modified.\n\n### What is actually happening?\n\nStart the dev mode with 'npm run dev'. Then modify app entry file, the vite build tool could not build automatic after app entry file modified.\n\n### System Info\n\n```shell\nSystem:\r\n    OS: macOS 12.4\r\n    CPU: (10) arm64 Apple M1 Pro\r\n    Memory: 115.83 MB / 32.00 GB\r\n    Shell: 5.8.1 - /bin/zsh\r\n  Binaries:\r\n    Node: 20.15.0 - ~/.nvm/versions/node/v20.15.0/bin/node\r\n    Yarn: 1.22.15 - /usr/local/bin/yarn\r\n    npm: 10.7.0 - ~/.nvm/versions/node/v20.15.0/bin/npm\r\n    pnpm: 6.11.0 - /usr/local/bin/pnpm\r\n  npmPackages:\r\n    less: ^4.2.0 => 4.2.0 \r\n    lodash: ^4.17.21 => 4.17.21 \r\n    miniprogram-api-typings: latest => 4.0.1 \r\n    typescript: latest => 5.6.2 \r\n    vite: ^5.4.8 => 5.4.8 \r\n    vite-plugin-inspect: ^0.8.7 => 0.8.7 \r\n    weapp-vite: latest => 1.4.1\n```\n\n\n### Any additional comments?\n\nI try to read the source code and get some information about the tool's config. It seems the chokidar received a wrong ignored value in runDev method, line 121 in context file. The 'mpDistRoot' field is empty default, so chokidar watcher received '**'.",
