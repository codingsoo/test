This workflow will ensure that all PRs meet the following criteria before being merged:\r\n\r\n**PR Description Check:** Every PR must have a description. If the description is missing, the PR should fail the check.\r\n    \r\n**Issue Reference Check:** The PR description must include an issue reference in the format Fixes #<issue-number>. If the PR is not addressing an existing issue, it should mention Fixes #NEW as a placeholder.\r\n\r\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\r\n\r\n- A GitHub Action workflow is triggered on PR events (opened, edited).\r\n\r\n**The workflow checks the PR body for:**\r\n- A non-empty description.\r\n- The presence of Fixes #<issue-number> or Fixes #NEW.\r\n\r\n**If the criteria are not met:**\r\n\r\n- The workflow should fail and return clear error messages.\r\n\r\n**If the checks pass:**\r\n- A confirmation message is outputted.\r\n\r\n**Expected Output:**\r\n\r\n- Error message if the PR description is missing.\r\n- Error message if the issue reference is missing or incorrectly formatted.\r\n- Success message when all checks are satisfied.\r\n\r\n**Additional Notes:**\r\n\r\n- This issue may serve as a foundation for more advanced PR validation (e.g., commit message format, label enforcement).\r\n- We can later extend this to check for specific branch naming conventions or enforce the addition of specific labels.\r\n\r\n_**Note**_: i'm expecting a gssoc-ext with level3 (or) level2 and a hacktoberfest-accepted label!\r\n\r\n@Luson045 ",

To improve readability, scalability, and maintainability, I suggest refactoring the `modules` directory by separating its contents into the following folders:\r\n\r\n1. **routes/** - For organizing all API routes.\r\n2. **controllers/** - To handle request logic.\r\n3. **middlewares/** - For middleware functions.\r\n4. **utils/** - To store utility functions.\r\n5. **validations/** - For organizing validation logic.\r\n\r\nThis refactor will make the codebase cleaner and easier to manage in the long run. However, it will require careful restructuring of existing files and thorough testing to ensure that no functionality breaks during the process.\n\n### Add Screenshots\n\n_No response_\n\n### What browsers are you seeing the problem on?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Record\n\n- [X] I agree to follow this project's Code of Conduct\n- [X] I'm a GSSOC contributor\n- [X] I want to work on this issue (Optional)\n- [X] I'm willing to provide further clarification or assistance if needed.",

It will ensure that all passwords meet a minimum security threshold, reducing the risk of unauthorized access and safeguarding sensitive user data stored within the system. This will improve overall trust and reliability in the project's user authentication process.\n\n### Benefits\n\n- Enhanced Security: Enforcing stronger password requirements reduces the risk of account breaches, protecting users' sensitive information from attacks such as brute force and dictionary attacks.\r\n\r\n- Compliance with Best Practices: The feature aligns with industry standards for password security, helping the project adhere to cybersecurity best practices and regulations.\r\n \r\n- Increased User Trust: By prioritizing security, users will feel more confident in using the platform, knowing their accounts are well-protected.\r\n \r\n- Reduced Support Burden: Stronger passwords reduce the likelihood of compromised accounts, minimizing the need for password recovery or account restoration support.\r\n \r\n- Scalable Security: As the user base grows, this feature ensures that security measures are consistently applied across all accounts, maintaining a secure environment for the entire community.\n\n### Priority\n\nHigh\n\n### Record\n\n- [X] I agree to follow this project's Code of Conduct\n- [X] I'm a GSSOC contributor\n- [X] I want to work on this issue\n- [X] I'm willing to provide further clarification or assistance if needed.",

This link should direct users to a password recovery process, where they can enter their registered email address to receive instructions for resetting their password. This enhancement will improve user accessibility and overall experience.\r\n",

Add validation to the date of the appointment to ensure appointments can't be made inn the past.\r\n\r\nAlso, rerouting to login page and registration page for those who are not logged in yet.",
