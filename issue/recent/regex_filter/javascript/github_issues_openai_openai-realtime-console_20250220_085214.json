When running npm run build locally the dist folder is inside the client folder so I tried changing the output directory in vercel to be client/dist but that still didn't work. I also tried the following vercel.json but still got no luck\n`{\n    \"version\": 2,\n    \"builds\": [\n      {\n        \"src\": \"/server/index.js\",\n        \"use\": \"@vercel/node\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"src\": \"/client/**/*\",\n        \"use\": \"@vercel/static\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }`\n\nIf anyone could provide some help it would be much appreciated.

This change is backwards compatible and requires an additional env var to be added to change the behavior, as documented in the updated README. The only item I'd flag is the relay server is referencing the same `REACT_APP` prefixed env var as the frontend which isn't standard for server code but I opted for this instead of using two different redundant env vars. An alternative would be that the relay server checks request headers for a key, and implicitly uses the presence of a key to use that instead of requiring a key provided via the env var, although for now I opted for the more explicit approach. \r\n\r\nPlease let me know if there is any feedback and I can make adjustments. I'm hoping to get this in so I can otherwise keep my forked code updated with any more changes that are made on the base branch.\r\n\r\n",
