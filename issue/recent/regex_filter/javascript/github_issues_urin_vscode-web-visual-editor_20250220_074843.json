Its purpose is to allow users to work with existing static HTML files directly.\r\n\r\nHowever, if you're working within PHP files and including local HTML files, you may be able to leverage this extension to edit those included HTML files. Just note that it wonâ€™t support dynamic HTML generation from PHP itself, as it is intended solely for pre-existing HTML files."
