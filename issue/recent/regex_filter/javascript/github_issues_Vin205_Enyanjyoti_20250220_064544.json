Image-Text Alignment: Match gallery images with their correct course descriptions.\r\n2. Layout Balance: Implement a grid layout for course cards to reduce clutter.\r\n3. Call-to-Action: Add a prominent \"Get Started\" button in a strategic location.\r\n4. Whitespace: Increase padding and margins around elements.\r\n5. Icons: Introduce relevant icons next to course categories and key features.\r\n\r\n### 📸 Additional Context \r\nCurrently, the About Us page has mismatched images and descriptions, creating confusion. The layout feels cluttered, making it difficult for users to focus on individual offerings. By addressing these issues and implementing the suggested improvements, we can create a more intuitive and visually appealing user interface that better represents our platform's quality and professionalism.\r\n\r\nassign this issue to @ananas304 with appropriate tags suck as gssoc, gssoc-ext, hacktoberfest.\r\n\r\nThankyou for your time:)",

    "body": "I’d like to propose adding a pre-commit hook to our backend application. This hook would run both **Prettier** and **ESLint** before any commits are made. Here’s why I think this is a great idea:\r\n\r\n- **Consistency**: By automatically formatting code with Prettier and checking for linting issues with ESLint, we can ensure that our code remains consistent across the team.\r\n  \r\n- **Efficiency**: This setup can help catch formatting and linting issues before they make it into the codebase, reducing the time spent during code reviews.\r\n\r\n- **Simplicity**: Having these tools run automatically means developers won’t have to remember to run them manually. It streamlines our workflow!\r\n\r\nImplementing this change could greatly enhance our development process and maintain code quality.",

This issue must be treated with the utmost seriousness to safeguard the project. 🚨\r\n\r\nAlso please add `hacktoberfest`, `gssoc-ext` and `level 2` label",

    "body": "Hi Team,\r\n\r\nI noticed the project is currently using separate frontend and backend folders, with React for the frontend. I’d like to suggest switching to **Next.js**, as it allows for building both the frontend and backend in a unified framework. Here's why Next.js could be a better fit:\r\n\r\n1. **Fullstack Capabilities**: With Next.js, you can handle both frontend and backend logic, as it includes built-in API routes. This eliminates the need to maintain separate folders for the frontend and backend, streamlining development.\r\n\r\n2. **Server-Side Rendering (SSR) & Static Generation**: Next.js supports SSR and static generation out of the box. This can drastically improve performance and SEO, especially beneficial for content-heavy or dynamic pages.\r\n\r\n3. **Automatic Code Splitting**: Next.js automatically splits the code, making sure only necessary components are loaded initially, improving page load times.\r\n\r\n4. **Improved Developer Experience**: The framework includes features like file-based routing and seamless TypeScript support, making development faster and more efficient.\r\n\r\nI also noticed that the Firebase label is added but not yet used. Next.js integrates smoothly with Firebase for features like authentication, database, and hosting, making it easy to manage backend services within the same project.\r\n\r\nLet me know your thoughts on this suggestion. I'd be happy to help with the migration if you decide to move forward with Next.js. Additionally, it would be great if you could add labels for **Hacktoberfest** and **GSSoC Level 3** to this issue.",
