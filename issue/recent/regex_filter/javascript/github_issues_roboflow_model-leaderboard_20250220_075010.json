This leaderboard this really helpful for model selection.\r\n\r\nI think you should mention what environment is used and what hyperparameters are used in website.\r\n\r\nHere are some possible information:\r\n- Python version\r\n- machine used to validate\r\n- confidence threshold\r\n- batch size etc.",
