Developed by Ericsson in the 1980s for telecom applications, it features lightweight processes, message passing, and hot code swapping, allowing systems to be updated without downtime. Erlang's robust concurrency model, based on the Actor model, is particularly well-suited for applications requiring high availability and scalability, such as telecommunications, messaging systems, and real-time services. Its strengths in reliability and maintainability have made it popular for modern web applications and distributed systems.",
