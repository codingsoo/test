    "body": "When resources are loaded eagerly, `ActionMailer` is being required by Marksmith. The Rails application I'm building does not include `ActionMailer` and therefore it breaks when `config.eager_load = true`\n\nMaybe it's by design, but it requires some hacking around to make it work.\n\nThank you for the work on this gem (pun intended)!\n\n---\n\n**Error**\n```bash\n /Users/elvinas/.local/share/mise/installs/ruby/3.4.1/lib/ruby/gems/3.4.0/gems/marksmith-0.1.2/app/mailers/marksmith/application_mailer.rb:2:in '<module:Marksmith>': uninitialized constant Marksmith::ActionMailer (NameError)                     web    |\n   class ApplicationMailer < ActionMailer::Base\n                             ^^^^^^^^^^^^\n Did you mean?  ActionCable\n```\n\n---\n\n**Workaround**\n\n```ruby\n# config/initializers/marksmith.rb\n\nmodule Marksmith\n  class ActionMailer\n    class Base; end\n  end\n\n  class ApplicationMailer\n    def default(**); end\n  end\nend\n```\n\nThis is kind of related and inspired by #18",

        "body": "Hey @yorsant, as far as I understand, by default, Marksmith requires ActiveStorage installed in the application for things to work, that's where the missing URL helper is coming from.\n\nEven though you can pass `upload_url` as an argument to the form helper:\n\n```erb\n<%# app/views/marksmith/shared/_editor.html.erb %>\nupload_url = if local_assigns[:upload_url].present?\n  local_assigns[:upload_url]\nelsif defined?(ActiveStorage)\n  main_app.rails_direct_uploads_url\nend\n```\n\nAs far as I can tell, Active Storage is hardcoded in the `#pathFromBlob` method of the Marksmith Stimulus controller because it uses the Active Storage route prefix to generate the link that ends up inserting into the editor:\n\n```javascript\n// app/frontend/controllers/marksmith_controller.js\n#pathFromBlob(blob) {\n  return `/rails/active_storage/blobs/redirect/${blob.signed_id}/${blob.filename}` \n}\n```\n\nI hope this helps."
