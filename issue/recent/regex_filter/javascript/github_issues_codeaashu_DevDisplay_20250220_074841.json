    "body": "### What feature?\n\n### Offline First Experience with Caching and Sync Status Indicator\r\n\r\nIn today’s digital environment, users often encounter connectivity issues, which can disrupt their interaction with a website or application. Implementing an \"Offline First\" approach could greatly improve user experience, especially for those accessing the platform in areas with intermittent internet access. \r\n\r\nThe idea is to integrate offline support in the app, ensuring users can still browse core content and access cached data even when they temporarily lose connectivity. By using service workers to cache essential assets and certain frequently accessed data, we can ensure that the application remains accessible and performs smoothly offline. Additionally, we’ll implement a **Sync Status Indicator** to keep users informed about their connectivity state. This status component can display whether they’re online, offline, or in a syncing state, helping them better understand the app's behavior. \r\n\r\nFor example, consider a platform similar to YouTube. Offline capabilities would allow users to load recent data or static content even if their connection is unstable, making for a seamless experience. The sync status indicator adds transparency, showing users when their content is being updated or when the app is operating with cached data.\r\n\r\nThis enhancement would add significant reliability to the application, benefiting a wide range of users, and setting the project apart from others that don’t offer offline functionality.\r\n\r\n@codeaashu  Assign this to me under GSSoC 2024 Ext and Hacktoberfest. I will work on this issue.\n\n### Add screenshots\n\nAdd screenshots\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [X] I agree to follow this project's Code of Conduct",

This workflow will ensure that all PRs meet the following criteria before being merged:\r\n\r\n**PR Description Check:** Every PR must have a description. If the description is missing, the PR should fail the check.\r\n    \r\n**Issue Reference Check:** The PR description must include an issue reference in the format Fixes #<issue-number>. If the PR is not addressing an existing issue, it should mention Fixes #NEW as a placeholder.\r\n\r\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\r\n\r\n- A GitHub Action workflow is triggered on PR events (opened, edited).\r\n\r\n**The workflow checks the PR body for:**\r\n- A non-empty description.\r\n- The presence of Fixes #<issue-number> or Fixes #NEW.\r\n\r\n**If the criteria are not met:**\r\n\r\n- The workflow should fail and return clear error messages.\r\n\r\n**If the checks pass:**\r\n- A confirmation message is outputted.\r\n\r\n**Expected Output:**\r\n\r\n- Error message if the PR description is missing.\r\n- Error message if the issue reference is missing or incorrectly formatted.\r\n- Success message when all checks are satisfied.\r\n\r\n**Additional Notes:**\r\n\r\n- This issue may serve as a foundation for more advanced PR validation (e.g., commit message format, label enforcement).\r\n- We can later extend this to check for specific branch naming conventions or enforce the addition of specific labels.\r\n\r\n_**Note**_: i'm expecting a gssoc-ext with level3 and a hacktoberfest-accepted label!\r\n\r\n@codeaashu ",
