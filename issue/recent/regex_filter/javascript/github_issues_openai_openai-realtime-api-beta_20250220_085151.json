(`examples/node_devenv.mjs`)\r\n* **Environment Configuration**: Integrated `dotenv` to manage API keys and environment variables. (`examples/node_devenv.mjs`)\r\n\r\n### Audio Management:\r\n* **Microphone Handling**: Implemented functions to start and manage audio streaming from the microphone. (`examples/node_devenv.mjs`)\r\n* **Speaker Playback**: Added functionality to play back audio responses using the `Speaker` module. (`examples/node_devenv.mjs`)",

I was struggling to get this working like I wanted and this really helped fast track getting things done right.\r\n\r\nOne point of note for others looking to leverage this example is if you have your computer's volume too loud the setup will start talking to itself ðŸ˜¹. Short term probably best to wear a headset. If you want to support features like you interrupting the model then you can't simply disable the microphone input. Might be some trick others know for this situation, but newer to voice based technology."

Most demos I've seen show a person saying something first, and then the AI responding, rather than starting with the AI saying something.\r\n\r\nIdeally, I'd like to create a new conversation, submit my system prompt, and have some flag like `AI Immediately Starts Speaking`, such that I start receiving streaming audio from the Realtime API as soon as the web socket connection is established and the session is created. Notably, I would still like to use `server_vad` turn detection -- I just want to start at the AI's turn.\r\n\r\nIf this is possible, I would greatly appreciate advice on how to set it up! And if not, would love to submit that as a feature request :)\r\n\r\n",

If the intention is to offload work and ensure your API remains lightweight, client-side resampling would make more sense, especially if you have control over the clients and can enforce this behavior.\r\n\r\nI'm personally not sure, so, should resampling the PCM data be done on the API or on the Client?",
