MaximumUploadSizeMB { get; set; } = 10;\r\n\tpublic CurrentThemeRecord? CurrentTheme { get; set; } = null;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nClass originally had responsibilities including \r\n\r\n- AddPlugin (plugin management)\r\n- SetTheme (theme management)\r\n- Load/Save to disk (persistence)\r\n\r\nI decided that is not very correct to have this class to save and i just renamed `ApplicationState` to `ApplicationStateManager` which does the same as ApplicationState and less, i.e. i moved `public Dictionary<string, PluginManifest> Plugins` into another place.\r\n\r\nSince IApplicationStateManager is a singleton, and it holds ApplicationState, it can be okay to run it.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor some reason I decided to add an interface definition for all classes in SharpSite.Plugins library, and more.\r\n\r\nI used `IApplicationState` interface for the reason that it can be accessible using interface `IApplicationStateManager`\r\n\r\nwich is also implements 'IStartupManager' interface\r\n\r\n```cs\r\n\r\npublic interface IApplicationStateManager: IStartupManager\r\n{\r\n\tIReadOnlyDictionary<string, IPluginManifest> Themes { get; }\r\n\r\n\tIApplicationState CurrentState { get; }\r\n\r\n\tpublic Type?

So we are breaking dependency and make this settings visible to others. We can comment out some interfaces to hide some internals from public.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
