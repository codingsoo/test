    "body": "Currently all of a worlds legend data has to be loaded into memory while using the application. For larger worlds this can take up a substantial amount of a computers available memory.\r\n\r\nSince the application is acting as a standalone web app it should be possible to transition to pulling the necessary data on-demand without being too noticeable to users.\r\n\r\nSince I'm still getting familiar with the source code I thought I'd start out by transitioning the bulk of the controllers to use a repository layer while retaining the original core logic.\r\n\r\nIn the future, the exact implementation details of the repositories can be updated without too much hassle which will make a change to a new data management system much easier.",
