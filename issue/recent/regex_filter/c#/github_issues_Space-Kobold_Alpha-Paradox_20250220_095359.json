It should also make it easier for inexperienced contributors to find code that is related to specific gameplay systems.\r\n\r\nThis structure should be migrated to over time to minimize breaking changes.",

Instead of directly modifying upstream files, the class should be made partial and a new file containing those edits/additions should be created in the appropriate folder.\r\n\r\nOriginally I considered moving all upstream content into its own root-folder as well but that would just be creating merge conflicts and make fork migration harder. If/when we end up diverging to the point of no longer regularly pulling/merging from wizden then we can revisit that but for now it will just cause headaches when integrating upstream changes or for forks trying to migrate.
