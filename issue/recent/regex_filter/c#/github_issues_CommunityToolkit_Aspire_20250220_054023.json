The dacpac is referenced as a PackageReference in the SqlServer project and normally published with the `IncludeCompositeObjects=true` option to deploy alle schema elements required.\n\nAs we attempt to adopt .Net Aspire, we are not easily able to do this without re-implementing the functionality of the `CommunityToolkit.Aspire.Hosting.SqlDatabaseProjects` package only to override the use of `new DacDeployOptions()` in `DacPacDeployer.Deploy()`.\n\nIt seems like a very usable feature to allow modifying the many `DacDeployOptions` properties passed to the Deploy operation for the dacpac in question.\n\n**Proposal**\nI thus propose an overload of the WithDacpac extension method for `SqlProjectResource `resource builders to set a new `DacDeployOptionsMetaDataAnnotation `which can be picked up when deploying the dacpac in the `SqlProjectPublishService` class.\n\nAlternatively, the `DacDeployOptions` can be created and populated with supported property values from the sqlproj file in a new `GetDacDeployOptions` method in the `SqlProjectResource` class similar to how the `SqlTargetPath` and `TargetPath` are attempted read in the `GetDacpacPath` method.\n\n**Help us help you**\nYes, I'd like to be assigned to work on this item, but am new to contributing on github.",

Closing the dialog closes aspire as well. \nMaybe someone has an idea how to solve this issue?\nWhen you set the SSDT Project as Start project in Visual Studio and start debug, you will have the same result.\n\nConclusion: \nIn think the best way to go is to connect the sqlServer database and a migration Project which itself has a reference to SSDT would be the best way to go.\n\n\n"

        "body": "> Having \".WithDacPac()\" in SqlServer ApplicationBuilder would execute the deployment every time.\n\n`.WithDacPac` already exists in the CommunityToolkit and works very much like the code example you give. (Hint: See the DacPacDeployer calss in the sources). The proposed feature above is specifically about allowing to specify DacDeployOptions as you also use in your example. Specifically to allow deploying composite dacpacs referenced by PackageReferences.\n\nOur organisations \"normal\", actually does include always deploying updated dacpacs to publish the latest schema differences every time.\nWe use safeguards such as setting `BlockOnPossibleDataLoss = true` to guard against problematic schema changes through our dev and test environments. This has been our deployment strategy for years and ahve yet to experience any problems.\nWe actually see this as one of the core strengths of using dacpacs over manual migration scripts. And it works great for us.\n\nWe do have the same annoyance with the Publish dialog which appears when you launch the Apphost project from the VS menu.\nIf you right clik the AppHost project and select Debug -> New instance (or without debugging) the AppHost will start as expected without the publish database dialog. I encourage you to file a seperate issue on this problem; and perhaps help solve the problem with a PR.\nThe problem is not specifically related to the proposed feature above.\n\nAnother problem we have, is when using the new beta Microsoft.Build.Sql SDK for the database project.\nWe experience that the `.WithDacPac` method fails to automatically get the dacpac file path from the .sqlproj properties.\nWe have this problem when running in VS. The problem seems to be an error in resolving the Microsoft.Build.Sql sdk.\nWe have gotten around this issue by specifying the dacpac path explicitly.\nWe were planning to log a seperate issue and perhaps contribute with solving the problem; if we at some point are able to identify the root cause. For now we get by fine using an explicit path.\n\nGenerally, what you want to achieve with manual scripts is actually possible using the core .Net Aspire packages.\nYou do not nescesarily need to use the Aspire CommunityToolkit for that. You can hook up your scripts by mounting them in the container and customize the entrypoint. I believe that the many .Net Aspire database samples includes such a scenario."

This can easily be solved by having an optional parameter on the custom WithReference for Ollama which allows specifying a selected model. If this optional parameter is not set, it will behave exactly the same as before: It would use the one specivied with WithDefaultModel on the Ollama resource.\n\n```diff\n+ public static IResourceBuilder<T> WithReference<T>(this IResourceBuilder<T> builder, IResourceBuilder<OllamaResource> ollama, string? selectedModel = null ) where T : IResourceWithEnvironment\n- public static IResourceBuilder<T> WithReference<T>(this IResourceBuilder<T> builder, IResourceBuilder<OllamaResource> ollama) where T : IResourceWithEnvironment\n```\n\n### Usage example\n\n```csharp\nvar ollama = builder.AddOllama(\"ollama\", port: null)\n    .AddModel(\"phi\")\n    .AddModel(\"phi3\")\n    .WithDefaultModel(\"phi\")\n    .WithOpenWebUI();\n\nbuilder.AddProject<Projects.Aspire_CommunityToolkit_Hosting_Ollama_Web>(\"webfrontend\")\n    .WithExternalHttpEndpoints()\n    .WithReference(ollama, /* adding this */ \"phi3\");\n``` \n\n### Breaking change?\n\nNo\n\nthere is no release yet (also this only adds an optional parameter to an existing method)\n\n### Alternatives\n\nSetting the environment variable (Aspire__OllamaSharp__{resource.Name}__SelectedModel) manually, but that is not easily discoverable without looking at this source code. Maybe the way currently in the playground was added with the intention to do this, but it does not work:\n```csharp\nbuilder.AddProject<Projects.Aspire_CommunityToolkit_Hosting_Ollama_Web>(\"webfrontend\")\n    .WithExternalHttpEndpoints()\n    .WithReference(ollama)\n    .WithEnvironment(\"ollama:model\", \"phi3\");\n```\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_\n\n### Help us help you\n\nYes, I'd like to be assigned to work on this item",

Though i do recommend people on my team do \"npm ci\" on their workstations to build the same thing that is on the cloud. Only the person playing with packages gets to \"delete package.lock && delete node_modules\" and then do the \"npm install\" stuff.\n\nTo be honest i haven't found the \"best\" github actions build scripts yet for Aspire. Before Aspire (i.e. 2 months ago), i would build, test and publish in CI (publish the actual artifacts such as the containers and such) and then deploy by creating sublayers with appropriate config for specific environments which get push to the right place. Aspire changes that as i have a solution with everything inside yet i don't want to deploy everything everytime... still working on it..."
