After this my laptop stucks on boot, showing f2, f9 or F12 menu, but doesn't react on hitting one of these keys. After removal of my SSD i can start my uefi BIOS. \r\nSo the Patch seems to have \"killed\" my SSD.\r\nHow can i \"repair\" the SSD, so that it reacts anymore or that i can reinstall Windows on it?",
