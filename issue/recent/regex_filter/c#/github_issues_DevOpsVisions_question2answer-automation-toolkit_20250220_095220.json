    "body": "I have refactored the code by applying SOLID principles and following industry best practices. Additionally, I have documented the code thoroughly to improve its readability and maintainability.\r\n\r\nThese changes aim to make the codebase more modular and easier to extend or modify in the future. I believe this will help the community contribute more effectively by simplifying the process of adding new features or extending existing functionality.\r\n\r\nI hope you find these improvements beneficial, and I look forward to any feedback you may have.",
