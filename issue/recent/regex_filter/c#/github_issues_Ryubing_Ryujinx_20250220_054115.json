Rust's ability to prevent null pointer dereferencing and data races would enhance the stability and efficiency of the emulator.\n\n### Smaller details\n\nThe addition of Rust could potentially reduce performance bottlenecks by utilizing Rust’s concurrency model. It would also improve error handling and code maintainability in critical sections.\n\n### Nature of request\n\nI wanted to do this but i want to see if people approve of this\n\n### Why would this feature be useful?\n\nRust's growing ecosystem, including libraries for gaming and emulation, could offer useful tools for the continued development of Ryujinx. A careful transition to Rust would minimize risks while leveraging its advantages in performance and safety.",

This was the case for my old 6750 XT and still is with my newer 7800 XT. \r\n\r\nThis workaround is not perfect however, and stutters do still happens here and there and on some graphical effects.
