    "body": "I rewrote some words and sentences, and where I could, I checked for inaccuracies. In addition to not being able to do everything, I also need to do something with the following: where my profile is, there is a post, followers, and subscriptions. In Ukrainian, there is a singular and plural, I replaced it with the plural, but it will be incorrect when there are 1 –¥–æ–ø–∏—Å—ñ–≤, if there should be 1 –¥–æ–ø–∏—Å, etc. For 1: 1 –¥–æ–ø–∏—Å, 1 –ø—ñ–¥–ø–∏—Å–Ω–∏–∫, 1 –ø—ñ–¥–ø–∏—Å–∫–∞.\r\nFor 2: 2 –¥–æ–ø–∏—Å–∞, 2 –ø—ñ–¥–ø–∏—Å–Ω–∏–∫–∞, 2 –ø—ñ–¥–ø–∏—Å–∫–∏\r\nFor 3 and up, what I have already edited.",

You'll have to edit the Ukrainian XLF file, not the RESW. \n\nThe RESW file is auto generated (by the build system) from the XLF. \n\nIn other words, your changes to the XLF will be automatically copied over to the RESW. \n\nCan you make the change to the XLF and remove the changes in the RESW?
