Very helpful for organization, and the Random Single option for groups (folders) is especially nice to see.\r\n\r\nHowever, I've been struggling to figure out why my Workshop collections have been failing to import. Earlier tonight I finally figured it out: Workshop collections will not import if their Visibility is set to \"Unlisted\", even though the collections in question are viewable with a direct link (or ID, which is how FireAxe finds collections, correct?). The same collections that refused to import when \"unlisted\", import fine when the collection's visibility is set to \"Public\".\r\n\r\nI'm assuming that this is a bug.",
