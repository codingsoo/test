Upon first launch, a `VRM` folder is generated in the root game folder. The user must place all of their desired .vrm files into this folder. Each time the program is launched, the mod will scan through this folder and assign a button to each discovered vrm file. Navigating to the character selection menu and clicking on a button will load the respective custom model.\r\n\r\nThe F4 functionality has been replaced as a hotkey to quickly open the character selection menu, as suggested by @morphicschris. Other ideas tossed around were an importer to auto-import .vrms into the VRM folder, or keeping functionality of both. I am open to ideas on this topic.",
