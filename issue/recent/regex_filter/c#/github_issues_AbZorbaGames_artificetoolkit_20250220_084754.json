        "body": "Hello @Draass !\n\nUpon your request and after an internal call, we decided to add serialization for **interface** and **abstract** classes natively to Artifice. It will be ready in a few days hopefully! \n\nGeneric types seem to be more peculiar and we will consider it in the future. If you could give us a use case of how you would want it to work it would help on our future discussions. \n\nAlso, there already exists an attribute in Artifice called `InvokeOnValueChange`. We haven't included it in the documentation yet since we have plans for minor refactors. I will refactor it with the above request and I will close the issue when everything is ready.\n\nThanks for contributing!"
