The application still uses standard SSL (HTTPS) connections and if your server has SSL certificates configured correctly then simply use the FQDN of your server and uncheck the box. \r\n\r\nLet me know if that information helps you?"

Version of Windows and WebView2?\r\n\r\nI know the previous builds had an issue with the config file not actually being checked and closing.\r\n\r\nThat all said not pleased about the virus comment, you can scan the installer or exe with what ever software you want before running.  As for the source your more than welcome to build the source code yourself its all there."
