        "body": "As the installer is a simple MSI, it is possible to run never versions on the same system and it will automatically uninstall the old version and install the new version. Historically we also supported Patch My PC but that relationship died with PowerON unfortunately. \n\nHistorically we didn't want to make the installers publicly accessible to minimise the chances of someone pirating the software. Now that the solution is open-sourced those limitations are no longer relevant and I've created a task #4 to distribute the software in a number of stores which support automatic updates. "

I'm hoping that a couple of organisations agree to purchase commercial support agreements which will enable me to re-invest some of those funds in a code signing certificate which will enable me to sign the releases again.\r\n\r\nIf your interested in purchasing a commercial support agreement for DPC please do reach out to dpc@darcy.org.uk and we can discuss the options in more detail"

    "body": "At the moment DPC has functionality to detect and restart the RasMan service if Windows encounters a specific bug with no known reproduction steps which stops new VPN connections being established.\r\n\r\nCurrently DPC is conservative about this restart as restarting RasMan will cause any other active VPNs to disconnect. This behaviour will be without warning and have no UI element (although it is logged in the event log)\r\n\r\nRecently someone encountered this issue however RasMan was not restarted due to the machine tunnel still being operational. This was giving the end user partial access via this machine tunnel.\r\n\r\nSo my question is this: If we detect this bug and want to trigger the restart (GPO setting must also be set) should RasMan be restarted even if the machine tunnel is still operational?\r\n\r\nVery open to differing viewpoints as ultimately these are your end-users who could be impacted vs easier/less support issues",

Typically, the device tunnel is supplemental and provides limited access before users sign in, so it should be low impact. Is it possible to use a GPO setting to allow the administrator to choose which option to use?"
