Is the slot forecast meant to be the rate of power generation per hour or the amount of power estimated to be generated in the half hour? \n\nPerhaps one of these has the damping factor applied and not the other.\n\nIncidentally it is not clear what the damping factor does to the estimated solar power generation. If 10Kw of solar power was predicted and the damping factor was 25%, would that mean the corrected estimate was 7.5Kw (percentage reduction) or 2.5Kw (multiplier). The 50% example unfortunately gives the same result for both methods.\n\nI just noticed a strange thing - if I increased the damping factor from 30% to 80% the total amount of power generation predicted on the label increased; I would have expected it to down. The half-hour forecast were unchanged.\n",

So if you set 80%, then it'll reduce the solcast estimate by 20%. Again, I can probably make this more intuitive, but I'm re-writing it so it's calculated automatically anyway (see #65) - once that's working, you won't need to manually set the damping factor at all (but I might leave it there as a manual override).\n\nI'm not actually using the solcast data to affect the charging algorithm yet, so until that happens, the oddities in the display aren't critical.
