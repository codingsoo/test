    "body": "The `مشاهده آمار واکنش‌ها` button is not functioning for some reason. Initially, I thought the multiple forms on the page might not have unique names, but that was not the case. Instead, it appears that Blazor was unable to pass `ReactionType.ShowList` as the button's value. However, setting the value to its equivalent number (-2) worked as expected.\r\n\r\nI added a new `ShowList` property to the `MarkAsAnswerAction` enum to resolve the issue and now the button works as expected.",
