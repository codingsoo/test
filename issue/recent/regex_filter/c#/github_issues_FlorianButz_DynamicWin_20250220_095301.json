    "body": "In `Discovered HardwareMonitor.Timer_Elapsed`\r\n\r\nWhile investigating NullReferenceException that happens sometimes inside `computer.Open()`, discovered that `Timer_Elapsed` was called again, before first call finished.\r\n\r\nI examined this by giving each call a new \"ID\". And tracking what the latest ID started was, in the middle and at end of a given method run.\r\n\r\nGot output like this:\r\n```cs\r\nHardwareMonitor EXCEPTION #6 seeing #8\r\nHardwareMonitor BEFORE #9 seeing #9\r\nHardwareMonitor AFTER #7 seeing #9\r\nHardwareMonitor BEFORE #10 seeing #10\r\nHardwareMonitor BEFORE #11 seeing #11\r\nHardwareMonitor AFTER #11 seeing #11\r\n```\r\n\r\nExplanation:  \r\n```\r\n* Timer_Elapsed run #6 got an exception, while trying to run at the same time as run #8.\r\n* By the time run #7 finished, run #9 had started.\r\n```\r\n\r\nFix:  \r\nUse a boolean flag to know when this code is already running.  \r\nIf it is, skip this run.  \r\n```cs\r\nprivate static long _iPrevCall;\r\nprivate static bool _isBusy;\r\nprivate void Timer_Elapsed(object? sender, System.Timers.ElapsedEventArgs e)\r\n{\r\n\tif (_isBusy)\r\n\t{\r\n\t\t// Skip this time.\r\n\t\tDebug.WriteLine($\"HardwareMonitor SKIPPED when called again during #{_iPrevCall}\");\r\n\t\treturn;\r\n\t}\r\n\t\r\n\t_isBusy = true;\r\n\t_iPrevCall++;\r\n\tvar iCall = _iPrevCall;\r\n\ttry\r\n\t{\r\n\t\tDebug.WriteLine($\"HardwareMonitor BEFORE #{iCall}\");\r\n... \t// ... YOUR CODE HERE ...\r\n\t\tDebug.WriteLine($\"HardwareMonitor AFTER #{iCall}\");\r\n\t}\r\n\tcatch (Exception ex)\r\n\t{\r\n\t\tDebug.WriteLine(ex.ToString());\r\n\t\tDebug.WriteLine($\"HardwareMonitor EXCEPTION #{iCall}\");\r\n\t\treturn;\r\n\t}\r\n\tfinally\r\n\t{\r\n\t\t_isBusy = false;\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow output is similar to this:\r\n```cs\r\nHardwareMonitor BEFORE #2\r\nHardwareMonitor SKIPPED when called again during #2\r\nHardwareMonitor SKIPPED when called again during #2\r\nHardwareMonitor AFTER #2\r\nHardwareMonitor BEFORE #3\r\nHardwareMonitor SKIPPED when called again during #3\r\nHardwareMonitor SKIPPED when called again during #3\r\nHardwareMonitor AFTER #3\r\n```\r\n\r\nOBSERVE: No Exceptions. Those were caused by attempting to use multiple `LibreHardwareMonitor.Hardware.Computer`s at same time.  \r\n (I did see one System.Management.Exception; don't know if this code or other code.)\r\n\r\nThis also should be better performance than running multiple at same time.  \r\n(Likely not significant performance for this code, but if app has other code with similar re-entrancy, could become significant.)\r\n",
