    "body": "## What's in this PR\r\n\r\n* New efficient functions to draw outlined and filled circles, based on the Midpoint Circle Algorithm, the filled one uses `memset` on the raw buffer for line-by-line rasterization.\r\n* Example files that shows off both functions (and acts as a test suite I guess)\r\n* Simple color utilities macros, so one can write FBGL_RGB(255, 12, 0) without dabbling in hex magic\r\n\r\n\r\n## Why the other changes\r\n\r\nOther slight errors are still being introduced in the repository despite them being detectable by compiler warnings that are already turned on by the `CMakeLists.txt`. \r\n\r\nFor example, various bound checks for the keyboard codes were present that were actually useless:\r\n\r\n```c\r\n\r\nunsigned char c\r\nif (c > 256) {\r\n// do stuff\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere `c` can never be greater than 256 as `c` is byte-sized, therefore it's maximum possible value is 255. This means that if the users enters 300 as a code, it's going to overflow to a correct value again anyway (you can't really catch this error library-side and you have to hope your user is listening to warnings...)\r\n\r\nAnother error that is flagged (and prevents compilation) is in `keyboard.c`, where the `atexit` function is called with the wrong number of parameters. I did not attempt to solve this as this requires a design decision that I am in no position to take.\r\n",

    "body": "## What's in the Pull Request\r\n\r\nA general overview of the changes can be found in the first commit message, which I'll paste down below\r\n\r\n### Commit message\r\n\r\nProvided a working CMakeLists.txt file to build all of the examples,\r\nalso fixed a bunch of bugs (some fixes also depend on personal\r\npreference and should be reviewed by maintainers):\r\n\r\n1. Switched fbgl_t types from size_t to uint32_t as there is no way a\r\n   screen resolution will be more than 2^32, this way we save 4 bytes\r\n   and we have faster comparisons\r\n2. Used int32_t instead of int for better clarity\r\n3. fbgl_point now uses int32_t instead of uint32_t, no more sign\r\n   comparison warnings (for loops that worked with fbgl_point were\r\n   already working with int32_t in practice)\r\n4. line.c now uses usleep(1000) to wait inbetween individual line draws\r\n   instead of an empty for loop, as that was optimized away in release\r\n   builds and led to all the animation being played instantly\r\n5. removed the void fbgl_set_bg() forward declaration as it was\r\n   incorrect w.r.t the actual function definition\r\n6. fbgl_draw_texture specifies a const pointer to the texture resource,\r\n   possibly allowing for compiler optimizations\r\n7. fbgl_set_bg and fbgl_put_pixel now use #ifdef DEBUG to compile away\r\n   checks in release builds, for faster performance (This has been adapted to FBGL_VALIDATE_PUT_PIXEL, according to `master`, I still suggest DEBUG so it can be done automatically by CMake)\r\n8. various const-correctness improvements\r\n9. all required UNIX headers have been imported so that\r\n   fbgl_check_esc_key does not give any more warnings\r\n\r\nAll examples have been tested (on my local machine, so take this with a\r\ngrain of salt)\r\n\r\n### Additional Changes\r\n\r\nThe `example` directory has been renamed into `examples`, files that have not been affected past that in this PR will show in the \"files changed\" tab as if the whole file was rewritten (this is how git sees renaming)\r\n\r\nFormatting has been applied in line with the `.clang-format` so there should not be any more useless diffs from now on.\r\n",
