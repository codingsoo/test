        "body": "there are few things wrong with this pr\n- the reason is not valid - layer surfaces should request exclusive area if they want to effectively 'shrink' usable area on the screen. in waybar config this is done by setting \"exclusive\": true. so if you have a bar on top with the height of 50px it would make that 50px exclusive. then if another layer of width 100px places itself on the left it will remove another 100px of the left side, so now your effective usable area starts at (100, 50).\n- this implementation breaks the current configs. even if we were to merge this, changes would be needed to make it backwards compatiable; that is, you still can specify a single argument, but you can also specify all four.\n\ntldr. i will not be merging this unless there is a good reason for it, as right now i dont see it as something that should be implemented by a compositor, but rather clients."
