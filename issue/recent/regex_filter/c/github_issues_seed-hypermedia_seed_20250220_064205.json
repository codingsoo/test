I thought I fixed all the usages but there seems to be something left still.\r\n\r\nI'm testing it by creating a document, writing something, uploading an image, and then resizing it (to make sure `size` is specified). First it was failing to publish all together, then I changed something and it started publishing, but the content was empty (right after publishing, the document was empty, and it was so for real, the API also returned empty documents). Now I've pulled the conde from main, and it fails to publish again.\r\n\r\nLet me know if you can find the problem.",
