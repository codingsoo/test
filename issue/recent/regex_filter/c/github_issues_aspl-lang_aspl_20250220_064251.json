I'll use a separate commit for that, though. Thanks again for the PR!"

I'm not very familiar with bash, but from a quick search, I don't see why we need it.\r\n\r\nAlso, I think it should be made a little clearer what a symlink is/why one might want it in the prompt you've added; some less experienced programmers might not know what it does. What do you think?\r\n\r\nBesides that, your improved installer script looks good to me, thank you again!"
