There are a few minor improvements that I want to propose here:\r\n\r\n- Some changes probably due to editing with newer KiCad version (8.0.5)\r\n- Fixed schematic filename referenced in `racer.kicad_pcb`\r\n- Add `.gitignore` for KiCad projects\r\n- Fix values of some resistors in the PCB file (sync with schematic). This is especially relevant as some PCB manufacturers take the KiCad PCB file and use it for creating a BOM to source parts for assembly, etc.",
