It supports more convenient ways to include dirs ( for example : add include paths for libs in plain makefile (need to modify compile flags for each complier) and in cmake you can just add \" include_directories()\"). It is your choice, what to support, but cmake is standard for crossplatform.\n\nAlso, cmakelists.txt can be parsed with ide (i use qt creator). \n\n"
