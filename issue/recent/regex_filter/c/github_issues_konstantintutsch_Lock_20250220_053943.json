I tried to decrypt a file or text but it tells me that decryption failed, it doesn't ask for the smart card PIN code (I use Nitrokey). I decided to look at the log output and ran the app in the terminal:\r\n\r\n`$ flatpak run -v com.konstantintutsch.Lock`\r\n\r\nand only in this mode he asked me for the PIN code of my smart card. But it was not a GNOME GUI window, but a CLI interface in the terminal where I ran the app. it was strange. Without a terminal I don't get any PIN code entry dialog, and only if I run it in a terminal I get a CLI entry form.\n\n### Which version of Lock are you using?\n\n1.0.3\n\n### Source\n\nFlathub\n\n### Relevant log output\n\n```shell\nF: No installations directory in /etc/flatpak/installations.d.
