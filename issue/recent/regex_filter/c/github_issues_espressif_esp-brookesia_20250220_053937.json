It should be possible to display a 12 hour format with AM/PM or switch to a 24hr format without AM/PM.  \n\n### Use cases\n\nSupport localization to display in the preferred format for a country.  Allows for creating products that meet the expected formats by end users in the target market.\n\n### Alternatives\n\nAn alternative would be to use a localization table to control various display elements, such as time, date, currency, temp, etc. \n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
