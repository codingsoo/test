I do sent the right color code but it sometimes just isn't translated well by the controller/leds themselves. \n\nIts basically also why for example Philips Hue costs 60 per bulb and some chinese alternatives costs 10. \n\nThere's a huge difference between leds when it comes to color reproduction and light accuracy etc. "
