I believe it is happening at step 3. When I follow the steps in the Alexa app, I notice that on pressing the power button, the power turns off, and then the brightness control shoots up to 100% then to 0%.

We don’t have any data for flic hubs. additionally I’d like to know if the flic hub couldn’t be directly integrated with home assistant without matter?\r\n\r\nYeah! Since the flic hub can now connect matter devices, adding a bridge created in home assistant to the hub you can then control the exposed devices by setting up actions in the flic app. I currently have 3 flic twists connected to the flic hub controlling exposed lights, but am only in the very initial stages of testing it out.\r\n\r\nI think there is an integration somewhere made to integrate the flic hub directly into home assistant (maybe flic2hass) but it doesn't support the flic twists as the flic SDK doesn't support them for some reason. Or at least didn't, not sure if that has been updated.\r\n\r\nI can answer any other questions if you have them, and can try controlling more devices than lights at some point, but have only tried a couple of lights so far with it.\r\n\r\nI'm currently away from home, but once back I'll update the integration at test out the update!"

    "body": "**Problem Description:**\r\n\r\nWhen using the Matter Hub via Google Assistant, reliability issues occur if a large number of devices are added without setting exclude rules. This significantly reduces the reliability of device control, leading to inconsistent performance.\r\n\r\n**Expected Behavior:**\r\n\r\nThe Matter Hub should operate reliably with Google Assistant, regardless of the number of devices added, without requiring specific exclude rules.\r\n\r\n**Actual Behavior:**\r\n\r\nWhen many devices are added without exclude rules, the Matter Hub performs inconsistently through Google Assistant. Devices often do not respond or only respond sporadically to commands.\r\n\r\n**Steps to Reproduce:**\r\n\r\nAdd multiple devices of different types (e.g., binary_sensor, sensor, switch, lock, etc.).\r\nConfigure the Matter Hub without any exclude rules.\r\nAttempt to control devices through Google Assistant.\r\nObserve that devices often do not respond as expected.\r\nResolution Steps Taken:\r\n\r\nI excluded binary_sensor, sensor, switch, and lock devices, and since then, all lights have been responding reliably.\r\n\r\n**Question:**\r\n\r\nIs there a maximum device threshold before reliability is affected? If so, it would be helpful to document this limit.\r\n\r\n**Environment:**\r\n\r\n- Matter Hub version: Alpha 26\r\n- Device types not in use: binary_sensor, sensor, switch, lock, lights\r\n- Platforms: Home Assistant, Google Assistant",

    "body": "Maybe I got the idea of matter wrong or I am making a mistake here.\r\nI have installed the new version via docker and it works fine after I had some problems especially when adding lights without colors (already found these here).\r\n\r\nNow I've added my hub to google home, which didn't work via the QR code, but this might be just my problem, because the QR code worked in smartthings. After that I can easily control the device. Works really well.\r\n\r\nNow I also wanted to add the hub to SmartThings, as I thought this is something I can do with matter. But the QR Code now has an overlay and says \"Commissioned\".\r\nIs this a problem with google home or do I have to create a hub each time I want to add it to something else even if I want to use the same configuration?",

        "body": "yeah unfortunately you cannot use the QR code twice. that why i added an overlay. but you can use the first connected controller to share the matter hub with another controller.\r\n\r\ne.g. with alexa you can open the alexa app and go to the hub device. there you can share the app with e.g. apple home (somewhere deep in the settings of the alexa app).\r\n\r\nI'll still need to create the FAQs / how-tos.
