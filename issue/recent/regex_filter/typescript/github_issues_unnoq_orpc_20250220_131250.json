Below is the current implementation:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nconst getting = os\r\n  .input(z.object({ val: z.string() }))\r\n  .output(z.object({ val: z.string() }))\r\n  .errors({\r\n    PAYLOAD_TOO_LARGE: {\r\n       status: 498, // optional, default status of PAYLOAD_TOO_LARGE is 413\r\n       message: 'default message', // optional\r\n       data: ErrorSchema, // optional\r\n    },\r\n    ANYTHING: {\r\n       status: 499, // required since oRPC not know the ANYTHING error\r\n    }\r\n  })\r\n  .func(async (input, context, meta) => {\r\n    throw meta.errors.PAYLOAD_TOO_LARGE({ \r\n        message: 'payment required'\r\n        data: {}\r\n    });\r\n    // equal to\r\n    throw new ORPCError({ code: 'PAYLOAD_TOO_LARGE', status: 498,  data: { } })\r\n\r\n   // this error will convert to 500 because the error is conflict with defined errors\r\n   throw new ORPCError({ status: 498, code: 'PAYLOAD_TOO_LARGE', data: { invalid: true } })\r\n   \r\n   // default status of PAYLOAD_TOO_LARGE is 413, so it will not conflict here\r\n   throw new ORPCError({ code: 'PAYLOAD_TOO_LARGE', data: { invalid: true } })\r\n\r\n  // this will throw like normal because it not conflict with defined errors\r\n   throw new ORPCError({ code: 'UNPROCESSABLE_CONTENT', data: { invalid: true } })\r\n   \r\n   // throw meta.errors.ANYTHING({ })\r\n   // throw new ORPCError({ code: 'ANYTHING' })\r\n  });\r\n```\r\n\r\n> oRPC only treat an error is conflict with defined error when the status code is the same but data or code it not match.\r\n\r\nWith built-in error like, validation failures and internal server errors, it will not prevent you from define but the openapi specs will always contain `or` in schema. Or the built-in errors will never conflict with your defined errors\r\n\r\nHow handle error on client? \r\n\r\n```ts\r\nconst [data, error] = await safe(getting)\r\n\r\nif(isDefinedError(error)){\r\n // error fulltype here\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith `@orpc/vue-query` or `@orpc/react-query` will work out of the box, but vanilla client will require you use helper function like `safe`\r\n\r\n\r\nWith this approach, we can achieve:\r\n- Type-safety for error data.\r\n- Automatic inclusion of errors in OpenAPI specs.\r\n- Typesafe error handling on the client side.\r\n\r\nI’m looking for feedback on the following:\r\n- Naming conventions for errors and related APIs.\r\n- The overall design pattern and approach.\r\n- How to handle common errors like input validation failures, authentication issues, and internal server errors.",
