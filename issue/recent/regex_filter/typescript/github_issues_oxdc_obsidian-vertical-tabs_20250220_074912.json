(See motivation for more details)\n\n### Motivation\n\nCurrently, when using tab navigation with a preset that has deduplicate tabs enabled, the following behaviour occurs: \nIf `Note B` is already opened, and from `Note A` an internal link to a heading/section of `Note B` is clicked (`[[Note B#Section A]]`), the tab from `Note B` will get focus, but won't go to `Section A`. This does not occur if `Note B` is not opened yet; in that case it will open a new tab that will have `Section A` in the viewport. Making these have the same behaviour would make navigation better and make the `[[Note B#Section A]]` links actually work when `Note B` is already opened on another tab.\n\n### Alternatives (Optional)\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional Information (Optional)\n\n_No response_",

    "body": "# Feature Overview\r\n\r\nallows users to save and restore the visibility states of multiple Groups\r\n\r\n# Use Case\r\n\r\nI use different groups to organize my workflow. Depending on different work requirements, I need to flexibly show or hide these Groups.\r\n\r\nFor example: \r\nI have 5 Groups: A, B, C, D, and E. \r\n1. In some cases, I only need to display Groups A, B, and C.\r\n2. In other cases, I only need display Groups C, D, and E.\r\n3. Sometimes, I need to use all 5 Groups simultaneously.\r\n\r\n# Current Limitation\r\n\r\nCurrently, Obsidian's Workspace feature cannot meet this need. While the workspace feature can save window layouts, they cannot maintain the hidden state of Groups. \r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n- If the current state is: Group A displayed, Group B displayed, Group C displayed, Group D hidden, Group E hidden\r\n- Save this state as Workspace \"Flow 1\"\r\n- Later, when reopening Workspace \"Flow 1\", all Groups A, B, C, D, and E will become displayed.\r\n\r\nThis behavior limits users' ability to quickly switch Group visibility based on different workflows.\r\n\r\nThe dirct integration of this plugin with Obsidian's Workspace feature may be complicated.\r\nBut Workspace feature is not needed if we can save and restore the visibility states of multiple groups.\r\n\r\n# Needed Features\r\n\r\n1. **Save Group States**: Allow users to save the current visibility state of all Groups as a named configuration.\r\n\r\n2. **Quick Switching**: Provide a dropdown menu ( or command palette option ) for users to quickly switch between different saved configurations.\r\n\r\n3. **Edit Configurations**: Allow users to edit saved configurations, such as renaming, deleting, or modifying Group states.\r\n\r\n4. **Hotkey Support**: Offer customizable hotkeys for saving the current state and switching to specific configurations.\r\n\r\n## Expected Benefits\r\n\r\n1. Convenience: Users can quickly switch between different work modes without manually showing/hiding Groups.\r\n2. Reduced Distractions: Help users stay focused by only displaying Groups relevant to the current task.\r\n",

I admit that it is unintuitive and could cause confusion. May I ask which of the following solutions you think is the best option?\n\n1. When a group is hidden, display only its name and hide all the tabs within the group. When the user search a tab (implementing), matched tabs of a hidden group will be displayed, but greyed out.\n\neg.\n\nBefore:\n\n- Group 1:\n  - Tab 1\n  - Tab 2\n- Group 2:\n  - Tab 3\n\nAfter:\n\n- Group 1 (hidden)\n- Group 2:\n  - Tab 3\n\nSearch for the keyword \"2\":\n\n- Group 1 (hidden)\n  - Tab **2**\n- Group **2**\n\n2.

I'll check with this.\n\nBy the way, could please explain why would you use multiple windows with multiple tabs open? Since most people don't have many open tabs in secondary windows and the design of Obsidian encourages the following use pattern:\n\n- You are encouraged to work primarily on a single window to focus on your work.\n- The main window provides sidebars, in which auxiliary information is gathered.\n- _Vertical Tabs_ should be in the sidebar. There must be exactly only one instance of _Vertical Tabs_.\n- You may open, duplicate or move a few active notes to a secondary window only for some special purposes, for example, pinning on the top of the window stack, moving to another monitor.\n- If you want to put the notes side by side, you should use workspace split instead.\n\nExcluding tabs in secondary windows is not a missing feature of _Vertical Tabs_, instead, it is designed to be so. But I will consider your suggestion if it is technically possible."
