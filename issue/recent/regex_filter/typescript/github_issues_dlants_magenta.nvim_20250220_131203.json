They kind of have an interface defined but the tool manager is stacks of case statements with deep knowledge of how each tool works.\n\nIf you plan on adding more tools you might have a better time by defining a contract for what a tool can do and remove all knowledge of tools from tool manager other than a list of tools and the plugs for the interface.\n ",

Right now it is quite verbose (as is pretty typical of elm / TEA codebases, tbh), however adding a new tool should still be pretty straightforward since the compiler and type errors will show you the places you need to update."
