    "body": "## Problem\r\nCurrently, traces in Laminar are immutable and cannot be deleted. This makes it difficult to maintain an organised workspace as traces accumulate over time.\r\n\r\n## Use Case\r\n- Workspace becomes cluttered with outdated traces\r\n- No way to remove unnecessary or obsolete traces\r\n- Need to maintain a clean, focused view of relevant traces\r\n\r\n## Current Workaround\r\nNone available - traces cannot be deleted once created\r\n\r\n## Proposed Solution\r\nAdd ability to:\r\n- Delete individual traces\r\n- Bulk delete selected traces\r\n- (Optional) Add confirmation dialog for deletion\r\n\r\n## Additional Context\r\nWhile deletion is the primary need, other organisational features like copying or moving traces could be considered for future enhancements to further improve workspace management.\r\n\r\n## Technical Considerations\r\n- Consider soft deletion vs permanent deletion\r\n- Handling of related spans when deleting traces\r\n- Access controls for deletion permissions\r\n\r\n",
