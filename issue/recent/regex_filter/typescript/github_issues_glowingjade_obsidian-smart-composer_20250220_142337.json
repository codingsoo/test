    "body": "Hey! 👋 Currently, the plugin works great (seriously smooth experience!), but I'm looking for better ways to connect with alternative API providers like OpenRouter.\r\n\r\nCan you develop some configuration methods or guidelines for users who want to use non-official API endpoints? It would be super helpful to have a flexible setup that allows easy connection to different providers.",
