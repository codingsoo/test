To prevent conflicts and ensure consistent formatting, you should integrate Prettier as a plugin in your ESLint configuration.

As in current docker file there is a line RUN npm run dev  I think we dont' need this and we need to put this in cmd CMD [\"npm\",\"run\",\"dev\"] because this is an command which will be keep listening to in coming requests for our app and docker file use to build the image and we don't need to run this npm run dev during the build.\r\n\r\n2.  We need to deploy the migration file of prisma  on db before starting the app and also need to add health check for db in our docker compose so that if the db container is health then we execute the command for our app container.\r\n\r\n"
