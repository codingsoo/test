    "body": "The lookup for existing users in `/core/session/payload.ts` does a straight lookup of the user email from the IdP. I believe this needs to be made lowercase since Payload forces lowercase email addresses when creating a new user. Some IdPs, namely Microsoft Entra in this instance, maintain capitalisation in the incoming requests, so my user in Payload is forced to be \"rhys@rhys.com\" but Entra is sending it as Rhys@rhys.com thus the auth plugin is saying the user doesn't exist.\n\n`const userQueryResults = await payload.find({\n      collection: this.#collections.usersCollectionSlug,\n      where: {\n        email: {\n          equals: accountInfo.email,\n        },\n      },\n    })`\n\nI have confirmed this issue by manipulating my user email directly in my mongodb and when matching the case of the incoming callback, it works fine.",

General-purpose linters:\r\n   - prettier@3.3.3 (Code formatter for multiple languages)\r\n\r\n2. Language-specific linters:\r\n   - eslint@8.57.0 (JavaScript/TypeScript)\r\n   - markdownlint@0.41.0 (Markdown)\r\n   - yamllint@1.35.1 (YAML)\r\n\r\n3.
