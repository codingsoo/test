    "body": "This pull request addresses the following updates to the tsup.config.ts file:\r\n## Output Directory Change:\r\nThe output directory for all build files has been changed from dist to build. This adjustment helps in organizing build artifacts better and avoids potential conflicts with existing files in the dist folder.\r\n## Minification Adjustments:\r\nThe CommonJS configuration now ensures that main.js is generated without minification, providing a more readable version of the code.\r\n\r\nThe ESM configuration retains minification for production use, generating a minified output file named .min.js.\r\nThese changes enhance the clarity and usability of the build process, making it easier for developers to work with the output files.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, this update is related to Issue #6, which highlighted the need for clearer build outputs and non-minified files for development purposes.\r\n\r\nPlease review these changes and let me know if there are any questions or further modifications needed. Feel free to adjust any part of this message as necessary!",
