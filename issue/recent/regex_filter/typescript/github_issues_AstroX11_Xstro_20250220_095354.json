This means the bot will not respond to messages, commands, or any events within group conversations, effectively freezing its activity in that context.\r\n\r\n- **Disable for DMs**: Likewise, disabling the bot for DMs ensures that it won't engage in any private messages. The bot will remain inactive in one-on-one conversations unless explicitly enabled.",
