Thanks for the pull request!\r\nI see that there's an excessive amount of changed lines, probably because your editor has added semicolons to all lines and done some other formatting stuff. I'll add a prettierrc file with the right formating settings tomorrow, then you can update the pull request so it looks a bit cleaner :)"
