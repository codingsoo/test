A few days ago I was playing a contribution stream and it was lagging a bit too much so I thought it was sourced from another streaming website, but they were indeed debrid streams.

These are mainly files from private trackers that aren't available anywhere else. Unfortunately this add-on is not actively developed anymore and doesn't seem to work anymore.\nI was wondering if webdav support could be added to this add-on? I don't know how difficult that is, so if it is too much work please close this request.\n\n\n\n### Proposed Solution\n\nIntegrating webdav support through Davio if possible.",
