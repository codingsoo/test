We‚Äôll explore this option further to see if we can strike a balance.\r\n\r\n- **Windows installer paths:** I appreciate the suggestion!

The application currently supports video and audio conversion, but users could greatly benefit from the ability to convert images into various formats as well. The addition of image conversion will further establish Comet as a versatile media conversion tool.\r\n\r\n### Feature Details\r\n\r\n<!-- Please describe the now requesting feature to the best of your abilities. -->\r\n\r\nThe requested feature should allow users to convert image files between different popular formats such as JPEG, PNG, BMP, and others. This feature should be integrated seamlessly with the existing bulk file conversion system, allowing users to convert multiple image files at once.\r\n\r\nHere are the main requirements for the feature:\r\n\r\n- **Supported Formats:** The image conversion feature should support the most common image formats, including but not limited to JPEG, PNG, BMP, GIF, and TIFF.\r\n- **Bulk Image Conversion:** Users should be able to convert multiple images simultaneously, just like they currently can with video and audio files.\r\n- **Output Settings:** There should be options for configuring image quality and format, similar to how video and audio output settings are currently handled.\r\n- **Real-Time Feedback:** The conversion progress for images should be displayed in the same way as it is for video and audio, including real-time updates and error handling.\r\n- **Performance Considerations:** The image conversion should be optimized for speed and resource efficiency, powered by FFmpeg.\r\n\r\n#### Additional Information\r\n\r\n<!-- Please describe the now requesting feature to the best of your abilities. -->\r\n\r\nThe image conversion feature will elevate Comet to a more complete media conversion tool, handling all major media types (video, audio, and images). This enhancement would be particularly valuable for users who need to work with multiple types of media files and wish to handle them all within a single, user-friendly application.",
