    "body": "### What feature would you like to see?\n\n**Problem Statement:**\n\n- Currently, the language selection box is placed in the aside section. When a user selects \"All Snippets,\" multiple code snippets are displayed on the right side. If the user scrolls down significantly, they need to scroll back up again to change the language, which disrupts the user experience.\n\n<hr/>\n\n**Proposed Solution:**\n\nTo improve usability, we can implement one of the following solutions:\n\n- Fix the Position: Make the language selection box sticky so that it remains visible when the user scrolls down.\n- Restrict the Code Snippet List Height: Limit the height of the code snippet list and make it scrollable, ensuring the language selection box remains accessible without extra scrolling.\n\n<hr/>\n\n**Expected Benefits:**\n\n- Enhances user experience by making language switching more convenient.\n- Reduces unnecessary scrolling, especially when many snippets are displayed.\n- Improves accessibility and usability for users navigating through large lists of code snippets.",

Personally, I like the 2nd idea because categories are likely grow as well and we might have to set a height for it in the future. Therefore, perhaps, setting heights for both categories and snippets? I'm open to listening your thoughts on this.  "

I appreciate the detailed feedback.\r\n\r\n### Snippets Returning vs. Printing\r\n- I can update each snippet to return the Fibonacci value instead of printing it. That way, it aligns with the project‚Äôs guidelines to return a result rather than produce console output.\r\n\r\n### C and C++ Snippets\r\n- Yes, they appear very similar, but I included both because the syntax and file extensions differ between the two languages. Please let me know if you‚Äôd prefer a single snippet or a different approach.\r\n\r\n### Existing Fibonacci Snippets\r\n- I couldn‚Äôt find any existing Fibonacci snippets in the repo. Could you please point me in the right direction or provide a link? I‚Äôd be happy to remove duplicates or update mine to avoid overlap if they exist.\r\n\r\n### Workflow Changes\r\n- I‚Äôll remove the workflow changes from this PR. I understand that changes to the workflow should be in a dedicated PR, so I‚Äôll open a separate one for that.\r\n\r\n### Multiple Languages in One PR\r\n- Since these are the same snippet concepts in different languages, I added them together. However, if you prefer separate PRs for each language in the future, please let me know, and I‚Äôll adjust my approach.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you have any further suggestions or need clarifications. If you can direct me to where the existing Fibonacci snippets are located, I‚Äôll ensure my changes adhere to the existing code.\r\n\r\nThank you again for your guidance, and I look forward to making the necessary revisions!\r\n"
