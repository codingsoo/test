        "body": "I've tweaked the scaling so that the internal mouse coordinates are now correct. However, the disadvantage is that any rescaling of the canvas will cause a reset and all your annotations will be gone. Hopefully that doesn't impact too many people...\n\nAnother solution might be to store all the annotation lines using some data structures and plot them similar to how the nodes and edges are being plotted. However that introduces a bunch of additional overhead which might not be ideal too.\n\nAnyways thanks a lot for your help to find all these bugs!"
