The download process should be handled safely as it is done in the model page, ie checking storage space and monitoring for memory warnings, etc.\r\n- [x] Add warning icon on pals card that the default model is not downloaded. \r\n"

This is particularly frustrating when generating large text responses.\n\nSolution:\nImplement a feature that keeps the screen on while a generative process is active. This could be a toggle in the app's settings.\n\nUse Case:\n * Long text generation: When writing long articles, essays, or creative writing, the screen turning off can disrupt the flow and lead to lost ideas.\n * Code generation: Writing complex code or running long-running scripts can benefit from a persistent screen to avoid interruptions and easily view output.\nAdditional Considerations:\n * Battery: This feature may impact battery life. Consider providing an option to turn off the feature after a certain period of inactivity.\n * Wake lock: Use the Android WakeLock API to prevent the screen from turning off.\n",
