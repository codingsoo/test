That way ts and node.js will both respect the exports in all your dependencies and resolve the correct type for your commonjs project.\n2. There is an issue in hono-openapi's exports in its package.json. The exports currently only point to the correct types for commonjs. This is the same issue as in issue #2.

Therefore, bump this package to use v4.0.0.\r\n\r\nTested with a simple server and nothing seems to be broken. Please take a look when possible @MathurAditya724 ",
