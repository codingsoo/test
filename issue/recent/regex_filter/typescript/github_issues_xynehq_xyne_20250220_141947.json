    "body": "# why\r\nSearch rankings across schemas were overlapping, leading to exact match results appearing lower in the list.\r\n\r\n# what changed\r\n- Removed skewed heuristic weights for `title`, `chunks`, and `vectors`.\r\n- Introduced a new title_vector score for better matching.\r\n- logic to prioritize vectors score with strong matches between title_vector and chunk_vector.\r\n- Alpha value to tune BM25 and vector_search.\r\n- Added a tunable parameter `bm25ChunkWeight` to control chunk weights in BM25.\r\n- Removed stopwords from the query to better match BM25.\r\n- Updated document recency in ranking. If the createdAt field is missing, it defaults to 3 months ago.\r\n\r\n# test plan\r\n",

This shows better precision and recall wise could find better quality(key pieces needed to answer the query) chunks relatively."
