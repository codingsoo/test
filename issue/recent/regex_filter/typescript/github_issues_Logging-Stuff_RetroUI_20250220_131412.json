    "body": "## Consolidate Heading Components into a Single `Text` Component\r\n\r\nThis pull request consolidates individual heading components (`H1`, `H2`, `H3`, `H4`, `H5`, and `H6`) into a single, flexible `Text` component. This approach streamlines the implementation of headings while maintaining semantic HTML and accessibility.\r\n\r\n**Features:**\r\n\r\n- **Single `Text` Component:** A unified component that allows users to specify the desired heading level (from `h1` to `h6` and `p`) using props, while applying the appropriate styles for each level.\r\n- **Variant Support:** Utilizes class-variance-authority to handle styling variants, ensuring consistent typography across different heading levels.\r\n- **Flexible Props:** Supports `className`, `component`, and additional HTML attributes, allowing for extensive customization and integration.\r\n- **Improved Documentation:** Updated documentation includes usage examples and guidelines for the new consolidated component, making it easier for developers to adopt.\r\n\r\n**Usage Example:**\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\nimport { Text } from \"./Text\";\r\n\r\nconst ExampleComponent = () => {\r\n  return (\r\n    <div>\r\n      <Text as=\"h1\">This is an H1 Heading</Text>\r\n      <Text as=\"h2\">This is an H2 Heading</Text>\r\n      <Text as=\"h3\">This is an H3 Heading</Text>\r\n      <Text as=\"h4\">This is an H4 Heading</Text>\r\n      <Text as=\"h5\">This is an H5 Heading</Text>\r\n      <Text as=\"h6\">This is an H6 Heading</Text>\r\n      <Text>This is a paragraph Element</Text>\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n};\r\n```\r\n",
