The main feature I'm wanting out of this new top nav is a notification system so that we can know when a planned update is coming and know how long the app will be down for. Can even use this system to notify users of things like when a new feature is available or when a preview link to test stuff out is available. This feature could help consolidate your efforts to inform your users on what's going on.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered:**\r\n\r\nA post in the Discord or post on Twitter when an update is planned to go out and how long it will be down for. I would say a notification on the home page but if the app is down then people won't be able to see that.",

However, I am encountering a limitation when developing applications that need to be integrated with existing ones. Currently, when uploading files, the platform allows a maximum of 5 files at a time, which complicates the integration of larger projects.\r\n\r\nI suggest two possible improvements to optimize this process:\r\n\r\nGitHub Integration: Allow me to directly link a GitHub repository. This would facilitate complete project imports and simplify version and code update management.\r\n\r\nIncrease File Upload Limit: Expanding the upload limit to more than 5 files, or enabling bulk uploads (by folder), would significantly help in integrating and modifying complex applications.\r\n\r\nThese improvements would make the development process more agile, especially when working with applications that require multiple dependencies or components.\r\n\r\nCongratulations to the team on the excellent work!

    "body": "Currently, Bolt AI doesn’t support importing existing projects, which can make it difficult for users who want to continue working on projects that were started in other environments. This lack of import functionality means users can't easily integrate their previous work and take full advantage of the tools available in Bolt AI to enhance or expand their projects.\r\n\r\nIt would be incredibly helpful to have an option in Bolt AI to import projects directly from various sources, such as Git repositories, ZIP files, or cloud storage platforms. This would allow users to quickly bring their work into Bolt AI, enabling them to manage and develop existing projects seamlessly within the platform.\r\n\r\nWhile some users may try workarounds like manually copying code or restructuring projects to fit Bolt AI's setup, these methods are time-consuming and prone to compatibility issues. Adding an import feature would not only save time but also make Bolt AI a more versatile tool, allowing users to streamline their workflows and centralize project development.",

        "body": "Agreed and appreciate the feedback here! The team is currently working on improved GitHub integration. Currently, we do support public GitHub repositories, which you can access by putting bolt.new in front of the repository URL: bolt.new/[PUBLIC REPOSITORY URL]\r\n\r\nAdditionally, we do support private StackBlitz native projects. To utilize this workaround you will need to download your GitHub repo, create an empty StackBlitz project, drag and drop your GitHub project files into the StackBlitz filesystem, save, and then use the “Open in Bolt” button to work on the project in Bolt. It is important to be aware that Bolt cannot support very large codebases, so this is only recommended for small projects.\r\n\r\nThis is an area you can expect to see improve and we appreciate your patience as the team works to make this process more fluid!"

This results in the loss of valuable code snippets and discussions when the browser is closed or the page is refreshed, disrupting workflow and making it challenging to resume projects efficiently.\r\n\r\n## Describe the solution you'd like:\r\n\r\nI propose introducing a mechanism that automatically saves the entire chat history, including code snippets, at regular intervals or upon significant events (e.g., closing the browser). Upon reopening Bolt.new, users should have the option to restore their previous session, allowing them to seamlessly continue from where they left off.\r\n\r\n## Describe alternatives you've considered:\r\n\r\nAn alternative would be to manually copy and paste code snippets into a separate document before closing the browser. However, this approach is cumbersome and prone to errors, especially during extensive coding sessions.\r\n\r\n## Additional context:\r\n\r\nImplementing this feature would enhance user experience by providing a seamless workflow, improve productivity by reducing the time spent on reconstructing previous work, and ensure data integrity by preserving valuable code snippets and discussions. Additionally, offering users control over their chat history, including options to clear or export it, and ensuring compliance with data protection standards would be beneficial.\r\n\r\nThank you for considering this request.",

Please describe:**\r\n\r\nI initially started my project on bolt (when it first came out), but because of certain reasons, i downloaded the project and started working on it in Cursor. Now, the project has become much more sophisticated with many more files. Unfortunately, the only way to create a new file in a Bolt project is to go into Stackblitz to create the file and then open the project in bolt. the thing is, i added around 100 files in the project after downloading it from Bolt. While i could copy and paste the code into a new corresponding file in Stackblitz, that just seems silly. It'd be amazing to be able to upload a project to bolt or stackblitz that way i don't need to copy and paste each file. maybe even to allow bringing in a project from a github repo and then being able to push your updates to the git repo, so now you can collab with people on a project not using bolt. For me, i do enjoy programming on Cursor for it's variety of use cases, and I enjoy the great design skills of Bolt and its interconnectivity with the backend. So, if I could work off the same files instead of copying and pasting code over to each other, that'd be great.",

So I'm not at all surprised that these tools don't handle all of that complexity.\r\n\r\nThe complexity however is not so much code related but just having set up a lot of accounts and jump through a lot of hoops depending on how much functionality your app needs. For example things like push notifications and in-app purchases require a lot of extra services to be configured and agreements to be signed etc.\r\n\r\nHowever.. just getting your web app to run on your phone in dev mode (eg only you and trusted friends and family can access the app but it's not available to the public) is actually pretty straightforward. AI is certainly helpful in helping you set up all of these steps, but this is just much harder to 1-click automate.\r\n\r\nFinally.. if you want to have tools like bolt generate your awesome web app and then you'd like start with the process of making it app-store ready.. then Capacitor is your answer.. at least it's what I've been using for years and it's become easier and easier to use thankfully. I'm sure Bolt could even help you set it all up for you. But you'll have to learn the CLI commands to have it installed on your phone and for that you need to set a few accounts up and learn how to sign your apps.\r\n\r\nGood luck! It's really not that hard but you need to learn a lot of little things."

I hope these can be addressed.\r\nThere is, currently, no apparent way to add tokens if you consume your monthly quota even though lots of tokens are wasted on the above issues.\r\nI purchased a year subscrition before the price increase and with these issues, I would not renew or increase my subscription. It only took a few days to chew through 20M tokens and by the time I get more, I will have probably moved on to another tool.\r\n\r\nHope these issues are resolved as the tool is very helpful.",

However, it really needs to move away from token-based usage and be more like V0 or Cursor messages. The current token system causes too many issues. For example, you told me I used over 1.5 million tokens in one day, but if you check, it was only about 30 minutes of usage. The AI gets stuck, and refreshing consumes tokens. Clicking the 'fix errors' button eats up tokens, and sometimes the AI fails to start simple tasks like running a dev command or gives errors for no reason. At times, the AI does things that weren't even asked for. It seems that output tokens are being calculated even when the AI is simply writing code or reading from GitHub. This results in a frustrating experience overall.\r\n\r\nDespite these issues, the product itself is fantastic, and we love it. The main problem is the token system. I suggest switching the monthly subscription model to message-based usage instead.\r\n"

    "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe:**\r\n\r\n<!-- In Bolt.new, tracking token usage is currently inefficient and lacks transparency. Users are unable to see how many tokens are consumed per session or per response, which makes it challenging to manage token limits effectively. This lack of clarity can lead to unexpected overages, disrupting development workflows and project planning. -->\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like:**\r\n\r\n<!-- I propose adding a comprehensive token usage tracking feature to the 'My Subscription' tab in Bolt.new. This feature would offer: - Session-based token breakdown: Each chat or session should display a detailed log of token usage per response, along with a cumulative total for the entire conversation. - Metric tracking: Provide average token usage metrics, such as tokens consumed per hour or per day, allowing users to better understand their consumption patterns. - Trend analysis: Include a dashboard that visualizes token usage trends, showing data such as average tokens used daily, weekly, or over specific periods. This would give users the ability to manage their subscription efficiently, anticipate future token needs, and prevent overuse. These features would empower developers using Bolt.new to optimize their token usage and avoid interruptions caused by exceeding token limits. -->\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered:**\r\n\r\n<!-- Manual tracking tools: While external tools can estimate token usage, they require manual input and are not integrated with the Bolt.new subscription system, making them cumbersome and inefficient. In-chat token displays: Some platforms show token usage per response, but this approach lacks the aggregated metrics and historical data necessary for informed, long-term planning and analysis. -->\r\n\r\n**Additional context:**\r\n\r\n<!-- A visual representation of token consumption over time (e.g., charts or graphs) in the 'My Subscription' tab would greatly improve user experience. This feature would allow users to forecast their token usage, ensuring that they stay within limits and make the most efficient use of the platform without disruptions. -->",

I wanted to add some translations since the people I want to show bolt to don't really understand English.\r\n\r\nI am not super familiar with this tech stack, so I hope the structure of the code I added makes sense. Feel free to tweak it if it doesn't! \r\n\r\nI added Spanish and Catalan. If you are interested, I can also contribute with French. The project is very lightweight in terms of text, so it should be pretty easy for other members of the community to add more languages.\r\n\r\nNote: I also had to tweak the prompt for \"enhance prompt\" because on top of enhancing, it was translating it into English. I think it should be harmless, but worth double-checking.\r\n\r\nNote2: For the title and subtitle in the landing, I changed the copy to be the same you have in bolt.new. I think it's much better and probably it was not ported to this repo.",

Not perfect, but would be super helpful so you can decide what problems to fix.\r\n\r\nLike if you ran a prompt and it came back with an error.

Please describe:**\r\n\r\nI got to a point where I see the message `24K of 150K daily tokens remaining.` Which makes me think I got 150k free daily tokens. \r\n\r\nI'm also invited to `Subscribe to Pro for 66x more usage.`. That would've been awesome, but the pricing tier says `Up to 500K output tokens per month`.\r\n\r\nSo I cannot clearly understand what get for free, and what do I get in the Pro tier. If it's 66 times more tokens, that would been around 10m tokens _per day_. But it says 500k _per month_ (which is like ~3 times the free daily quote, if I got the free daily idea correctly).\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like:**\r\n\r\nAn easy to understand tokens quota - per day/month, or whatever the limitations are.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nDespite that - it looks amazing! I am eager to test it a bit further (gimme those tokens 😈). Good job!",
