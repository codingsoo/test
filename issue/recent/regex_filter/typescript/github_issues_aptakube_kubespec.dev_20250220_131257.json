For example, you'll get an error if you try to create a pod without a container image even though it's not marked as required, but the docs say: \"This field is optional to allow higher level config management to default or override container images in workload controllers like Deployments and StatefulSets.\"\r\n\r\nReally useful tool, btw. Thanks!"
