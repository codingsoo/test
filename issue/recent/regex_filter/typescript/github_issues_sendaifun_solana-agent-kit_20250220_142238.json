    "body": "LangGraph is a library for building stateful, multi-actor applications with LLM, used to build agent-driven, multi-agent workflows. Compared to other LLM frameworks, it offers these key benefits: cycles, controllability, and persistence. LangGraph allows you to define flows that involve cycles, essential for most agent architectures, which sets it apart from DAG-based solutions. As a very low-level framework, it provides fine-grained control over both the flow and state of your application, which is crucial for building reliable agents. Additionally, LangGraph includes built-in persistence, allowing for advanced memory and human-intervention features.\r\n\r\nBelow are implementation examples for key components of the proposed LangGraph.js solution, which are aligned with the suggested improvements. Each example highlights specific functionality that can be incorporated to improve the library.\r\n\r\nExample 1: Predefined Templates\r\n// plantillas.json\r\n{\r\n  \"weatherInquiry\": {\r\n    \"description\": \"Climate query flow\",\r\n    \"nodes\": [\r\n      {\r\n        \"id\": \"userInput\",\r\n        \"type\": \"HumanMessage\",\r\n        \"prompt\": \"What is the city to check the weather?\"\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        \"id\": \"climateCheck\",\r\n        \"type\": \"ToolNode\",\r\n        \"tool\": \"weatherTool\"\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        \"id\": \"finalResponse\",\r\n        \"type\": \"AIMessage\",\r\n        \"response\": \"Weather information has been provided.\"\r\n      }\r\n    ],\r\n    \"edges\": [\r\n      {\"from\": \"userInput\", \"to\": \"climateCheck\"},\r\n      {\"from\": \"climateCheck\", \"to\": \"finalResponse\"}\r\n    ]\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n// Using the template in the code\r\nimport templateData from './plantillas.json';\r\nconst workflow = new StateGraph(StateAnnotation)\r\n  .addNode(templateData.weatherInquiry.nodes)\r\n  .addEdge(templateData.weatherInquiry.edges);\r\n\r\nExample 2: Configuration Wizards\r\n\r\n// Setup Wizard in a React App\r\nimport React, { useState } from 'react';\r\n\r\nfunction GraphConfigAssistant() {\r\n  const [nodeType, setNodeType] = useState('');\r\n\r\n  const handleSubmit = () => {\r\n    // Generates the node and adds it to the graph\r\n    const newNode = createNode(nodeType); // function that generates a node according to the selected type\r\n    addNodeToGraph(newNode); // function to add the node to the graph under construction\r\n  };\r\n\r\n  return (\r\n    <div>\r\n      <h3>Graph Configuration Wizard</h3>\r\n      <select onChange={(e) => setNodeType(e.target.value)}>\r\n        <option value=\"userInput\">User input</option>\r\n        <option value=\"toolNode\">Tool</option>\r\n      </select>\r\n      <button onClick={handleSubmit}>Add Node</button>\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n\r\nExample 3: Lazy Loading of Nodes\r\n\r\n// Function to load nodes on demand\r\nasync function lazyLoadNode(nodeId) {\r\n  const nodeConfig = await fetchNodeConfig(nodeId); // Function that gets the node configuration based on its ID\r\n  return new ToolNode(nodeConfig.tools);\r\n}\r\n\r\n// Execution of the graph using lazy loading\r\nconst workflow = new StateGraph(StateAnnotation);\r\nconst initialState = await workflow.invoke(initialInput);\r\n\r\nif (shouldTriggerLazyLoad(initialState)) {\r\n  const additionalNode = await lazyLoadNode('newToolNode');\r\n  workflow.addNode(additionalNode);\r\n}\r\n\r\n// Simple algorithm to detect when human intervention is needed\r\nfunction shouldPauseForUser(state) {\r\n  const lastMessage = state.messages[state.messages.length - 1];\r\n  return lastMessage.isAmbiguous || lastMessage.needsClarification;\r\n}\r\n\r\nExample 4: Contextual Interactions\r\n// Implementation in the workflow\r\nconst workflow = new StateGraph(StateAnnotation)\r\n  .addNode(\"agent\", callModel)\r\n  .addConditionalEdges(\"agent\", shouldContinue)\r\n  .addConditionalEdges(\"agent\", shouldPauseForUser);\r\n\r\n// Wrapper for an external API - Twilio SMS\r\nimport { tool } from '@langchain/core/tools';\r\nimport twilio from 'twilio';\r\n\r\nconst sendSmsTool = tool(async ({ to, message }) => {\r\n  const client = twilio(twilioAccountSid, twilioAuthToken);\r\n  await client.messages.create({ body: message, to });\r\n}, {\r\n  name: 'sendSms',\r\n  description: 'Envia un mensaje SMS utilizando Twilio',\r\n  schema: z.object({\r\n    to: z.string().describe('Número de teléfono al que enviar el SMS.'),\r\n    message: z.string().describe('El mensaje que se enviará.'),\r\n  }),\r\n});\r\n\r\nExample 5: Integration with External Tools\r\n\r\n// Add the tool node to the workflow\r\nconst tools = [sendSmsTool];\r\nconst toolNode = new ToolNode(tools);\r\nworkflow.addNode('sendSmsNode', toolNode);\r\n\r\nExample 6: Interactive Documentation\r\n\r\n// Using Jupyter Notebooks for executable examples\r\n# In Jupyter notebook content\r\nimport langgraph as lg\r\n\r\n# Initialize the graph\r\ngraph = lg.StateGraph()\r\n\r\n# Add a node\r\ngraph.add_node(\"Entrada Usuario\", callback=user_input_function)\r\n\r\n# Initialize the graph\r\nresult = graph.run(initial_state)\r\nprint(result)\r\n\r\nThese examples are representative of how the technical implementation of the suggested features to improve LangGraph.js can be carried out. Each example focuses on various aspects, from the user interface to integration with external APIs, offering a clear path towards implementing a more robust and accessible solution.\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "\r\nDescription:\r\nThis PR implements an SDK for Vercel AI in the Solana Agent Kit. A new Action interface was introduced that allows for the creation and handling of various actions using the Vercel AI model. Changes made include the definition of a handler to process requests, a validator function to ensure valid input, and documented usage examples.\r\n\r\nChanges Made:\r\nAction Interface Definition:\r\nThe Action interface has been implemented that structures the actions to be executed:\r\n\r\nCopyReplit\r\ninterface Action {\r\nname: string;\r\nsimiles: string[];\r\ndescription: string;\r\nexamples: ActionExample[][];\r\nhandler: Handler;\r\nvalidate: Validator;\r\n}\r\nHandler Implementation:\r\nA handler has been created to execute query actions to the AI ​​model:\r\n\r\nCopyReplit\r\nconst exampleHandler: Handler = async (input: any) => {\r\n// Logic to handle the query\r\nconst response = await sendRequestToAIModel(input);\r\nreturn response;\r\n};\r\nValidator Implementation:\r\nA validation function has been added to verify the inputs:\r\n\r\nCopyReplit\r\nconst exampleValidator: Validator = (input: any) => {\r\nreturn typeof input === 'string' && input.length > 0;\r\n};\r\nAction Example:\r\nCreated an action example that uses the new SDK:\r\n\r\nCopyReplit\r\nconst exampleAction: Action = {\r\nname: \"QueryAI\",\r\nsimiles: [\"Ask AI\", \"Get AI Response\"],\r\ndescription: \"Send a query to the Vercel AI model and receive a response.\",\r\nexamples: [[{ input: \"What is the weather like?\" }, { output: \"It's sunny.\" }]],\r\nhandler: exampleHandler,\r\nvalidate: exampleValidator\r\n};\r\nUpdated Documentation:\r\nDocumentation files have been updated to reflect new functionality and usage examples have been provided.\r\n\r\nImplemented Tests:\r\nUnit tests have been created to ensure the correct functioning of the handler and validator:\r\n\r\nCopyReplit\r\ntest('Validate input', () => {\r\nexpect(exampleValidator(\"Valid input\")).toBe(true);\r\nexpect(exampleValidator(\"\")).toBe(false);\r\n});\r\n\r\ntest('Handle action', async () => {\r\nconst response = await exampleHandler(\"What is the weather like?\");\r\nexpect(response).toBeDefined();\r\n});\r\nJustification:\r\nThe implementation of this interface allows developers to interact more effectively with the Vercel AI model, offering a unified framework that facilitates the integration of new functionalities into the Solana agent kit. This improvement also promotes code reuse and better organization in the development of future integrations.\r\n\r\nRequirements:\r\nNode.js and project dependencies must be installed and up to date.\r\nTests can be run using the npm test command.\r\nConclusion:\r\nI hope these changes will be helpful in improving the Solana Agent Kit. I remain available to make any required adjustments and to answer any questions that may arise during the review.\r\n\r\nRewards",
