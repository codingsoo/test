So great that I'd like the option to have it \"clip\" every website I visit automatically. \r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\nIn the Extension Settings, an option that would be default Off for privacy, but the user could select to have every page automatically clipped on page load. \r\n\r\nThe one potential complication (which I've experienced with Hunchly) is for pages with dynamic content that doesn't change the URL. So for example, if I'm looking at the X/Twitter homepage feed, it can be tricky to tell the plugin how to add/overwrite the clip when the content changes but the URL doesn't. I think the feature would be useful even if this were too challenging to solve.\r\n\r\n### Current workaround (optional)\r\n\r\nI am currently evaluating Hunchly as a workaround.\r\n\r\nI am also looking into ways I can configure Chrome to \"script\" Obsidian Web Clipper.\r\n\r\n### Related feature requests (optional)\r\n\r\nNow that the Web Clipper has Interpreter, this would be a very powerful \"automatic note-taking\" workflow. Basically, I just browse and trust that the clipper & interpreter are taking notes for me.\r\n",

It looks like the plugin is using the browser command and messages API to send the \"Quick clip\" action to the correct place in the plugin. \r\n\r\nI am very new to plugins, so it is possible I have misunderstood this, but the onMessage listener only listens for messages coming from the same extension. One potential solution would be to add a few lines of code with the onMessageExternal, which would do the same thing as the onMessage, but open up the message API so actions could be triggered by another extension.\r\n\r\nCurrently the quick clip is triggered by a keyboard shortcut, making use of the command API that allows plugins to bind a function to a keyboard shortcut. I have spent most of the day looking for a way to automate this, but I could not find anything. Injected user scripts are sandboxed, so no code based injection will properly trigger. There are also basically no tools for triggering a keyboard shortcut automatically.\r\n\r\n@kepano, it is possible I have misunderstood this, as I am a brand new developer. I am willing to try to PR changes, but this is my first attempt at contributing to open source, so I may need a little guidance. "

While this resolves the immediate issue, there may definitely be more optimal approaches 😄 \r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n1. Visit xing.com (or any other web page)\r\n2. Use highlight option\r\n3.

The Web Clipper template is like \r\n```\r\n| {{var1}} | {{var2}} | {{var3}} |\r\n```\r\nThe problem with that is that when the new content gets appended to the note, there is a blank line before it, which I have to manually remove, otherwise the new entry is in the form of a paragraph instead of a table row. It would be nice if there would be an option to append data to notes while stripping out the preceding blank line, as populating tables with content from clippings could be a powerful feature. \r\n\r\nI would also be interested to know if there is an event that I could listen to, that gets triggered when the new clipping gets added to the note. That way, I could probably strip it myself.  ",

    "body": "**Context:**\r\n\r\nI frequently use Obsidian Web Clipper to extract information from web pages, including video metadata like duration. Many websites, such as YouTube, provide video durations in the ISO 8601 format—for example, `PT6702S` represents a duration of 6702 seconds.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the available filters (`slice`, `date`, `calc`) don't allow for an easy conversion of this ISO 8601 duration into a human-readable format like `HH:mm:ss`. Attempts to manipulate the string and parse it using the `date` filter lead to issues with time zone adjustments, causing inaccurate results.\r\n\r\n**Feature Request:**\r\n\r\nI propose adding a new filter or enhancing existing ones to support the conversion of ISO 8601 duration strings directly into human-readable time formats without time zone adjustments.\r\n\r\n**Proposed Solution:**\r\n\r\n- **New Filter (e.g., `duration`):**\r\n  - Parses ISO 8601 duration strings and formats them according to a specified pattern.\r\n  - Example usage: `{{schema:@VideoObject:duration|duration:\"HH:mm:ss\"}}` would output `01:51:42` for `PT6702S`.\r\n\r\n**Thank you for considering this feature request!**",

At the moment, Clipper creates a new note without note properties if the note is created with a template behaviour option \"Add to an existing note, at the bottom\". So, I need to add note properties manually after creating the note with the behaviour option. I think it's common for users to have note properties at the top of the note for any newly created notes, so it'd be nice to have the note properties at the top as long as the note is newly created.\r\n\r\nMost importantly, thanks for the awesome Chrome extension!",

Install <0.9.6 via Firefox extension site.\n2. Wait for \"new permission required\" notification from Firefox.\n3. Tap \"deny\".\n4. Goto 2.\n\n**Your template file**\n\nSorry, I can't provide a template because I've uninstalled Web Clipper. It was whatever the default was.\n",

While it’s possible to copy the raw content, the associated properties are omitted. This makes it cumbersome to transfer fully formatted entries with all intended attributes.\r\n\r\n**Proposed Solution:**\r\n\r\nAdd a \"Copy with Properties\" button that copies both the content and its properties in one action.
