Afterwards the developer is free to create custom callbacks that are called whenever the value that such listeners hold changes in any way (do not use the actual value's methods, otherwise callbacks won't fire, use only those defined in the Listener class).\r\nWhen adding callbacks using `addListener` a string-id is required to recognize different callbacks and to remove them if needed.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, excluded domains are now automatically sorted.\r\n\r\nI'm open to any feedback, thanks again for your time.\r\n",
