Like maybe when the audio size is x size then the chunk is repeated twice.\n\nBut I doubt this. Cause if you ask the model to say \"Hi, how can I help you today?\" then it repeats it perfectly (and can many times) without the annoying \"you today?\" repetition. \n\nThat leads to the only conclusion that it is a server issue. I guess we'll have to wait until the model will no longer be under \"exp\" label and Google will release the polished model."

They said that on Twitter like a week (or two?) ago.\n\nAs for the temporary fix, well maybe add an if statement to check if it is a first response and if the message is \"Hi, how can I help you today?\" then if the bytes are longer than expected cut the end? Yeah I think something like that could be made. Or use speech to text models (by sacrificing speed) to first convert the model's output to text and check for repeating the last words. "
