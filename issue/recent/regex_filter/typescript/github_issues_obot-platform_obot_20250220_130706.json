The `WHERE` clause should return objects who column value is `NULL` as well as those that match the string. This is for migration purposes: the code will still filter out any objects that don't have this column set and whose field selector value doesn't match.\n\nDon't index these columns by default. The `WHERE` clause on the column may be enough to get the performance increase we need.\n\nWe use an interface to do field selectors. Add a method to this interface to indicate which columns should be indexed. Then the indexes can be added when the database is migrated on startup.",

In hosted environments, this will actually be writing all the way to S3. That may cause lag, but that’s where we want to start and see how bad it is.\r\n- The inputs and output of the tool should be “raw”, meaning we want the tool to accept sql(lite) statements and return sql output. It’ll be up to the calling agent/gptscript to form the query & format the response.\r\n- Generally, we want markdown tables to be the default way the agent outputs data from queries.\r\n- The tool’s context should be where the “magic” happens to the calling agent know how to use it. It should do things like:\r\n  - Tell the LLM it can create and modify tables and should do so on demand.\r\n  - Dump the DB schema into the context so the llm knows its form. Maybe even a row from each table?\r\n- The goal is that the user shouldn’t really see the sql. They should be able to ask things in natural language and should see results as markdown tables.\r\n- Not too important to the impl, but FYI if we ran this in a SaaS, we might use turso (sqlite saas) to back it\r\n- Tool should support creating and modifying tables and rows. Probably delete rows and tables too (but that randomly seems scary to me :shrug:)\r\n- A sample user message for this: “List my emails and store them in a table with these columns...”",

Run `Authenticate` ( You dont have to do this step as well). \r\n8. Use `Run workflow` to run the workflow again.\r\nTool call will fail with needing environment variable which is as expected.\r\n9.

Use `Authenticate` \r\nNotice that we are not prompted to enter `MY_ENV` variable ( the credential created from step4 is still present) and presented with `DONE`.\r\n11.

Refreshing gets the new data.\n\noptions here are to either make the response synchronous or implement Polling in the UI. ~~If we were to go with Polling, I'd probably want some indicator as to when the tool was last updated so I know when to stop polling for the updates~~\n\nEdit: I tried using `revision` as an indicator, but that did not help because there will be times where `Force Refresh` is triggered and there will be no changes to the repo. In this scenario, polling would start but never stop (unless with an arbitrary timeout)\n\nWith this in mind polling is not a good solution and I'd push to make the api synchronous. Very open to discussion on the matter though.\n\nWDYT?"
