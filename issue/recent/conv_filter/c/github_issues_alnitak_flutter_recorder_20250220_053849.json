    "body": "**Description**\n\nWhen attempting to start recording with an invalid filename using the `recorder.startRecording` method, a `RecorderFailedToInitializeRecordingException` is thrown. The error message does not provide sufficient information about the cause of the issue.\n\n**Steps To Reproduce**\n\n1. Include two colons (:) in the filename.\n2. Pass the file path to the `recorder.startRecording` method.\n\n**Example Code**\n\nDart\n```\nfinal DateTime now = DateTime.now();\nfinal DateFormat formatter = DateFormat('MMdd_HH:mm:ss');\nfinal String timestamp = formatter.format(now);\n\nString path = p.join(\n  r\"C:\\Users\\Username\\Documents\\Projects\\voicebot_flutter\\app\\voicebot\\a_recording\",\n  'my_file_$timestamp.wav',\n);\n\nrecorder.startRecording(completeFilePath: path);\n```\n\n**Expected Behavior**\n\nThe `recorder.startRecording` method should throw an exception with a clear error message indicating that the filename is invalid.\n\n**Actual Behavior**\n\nA `RecorderFailedToInitializeRecordingException: The recording failed to start (on the C++ side).` is thrown with a generic error message that does not provide information about the invalid filename.\n",

Removing that check doesn't throw anymore.\r\n\r\nAlso, I think you should enable `Audio input`  and `Downloads folder` in XCode under Runner->Signin & Capabilities.\r\n\r\nI do not have a mac or iPhone to try and I am not familiar with those. I pushed a fix for this, can you confirm it is working now?"

You can do this via the UI as you suggested or you can just add the following to the `example/macos/Runner/DebugProfile.entitlements` and `example/macos/Runner/Release.entitlements`\r\n\r\n```\r\n\t<key>com.apple.security.device.audio-input</key>\r\n\t<true/>\r\n\t<key>com.apple.security.files.downloads.read-write</key>\r\n\t<true/>\r\n```\r\n\r\nHeads up I will post a new issue for iOS after I get a chance to look into some framework linking issues I am having here.\r\n"
