    "body": "If the nodes are numbered from 1 to n, and n is a two-digit number, then Current Nodes will sort the nodes in lexicographical order, such as `1 10 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9`, while the order of labels given in the problem is often `1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10`, which makes editing labels very annoying.\r\n\r\nOne solution I came up with is to add a switch to adjust the sorting method, switching between lexicographical order and numerical order from smallest to largest. However, when there are non-numerical values in Current Nodes, the numerical order from smallest to largest should be disabled",

        "body": "Hi, as a quickfix for now, would you be alright if I made the default sorting method such that all numbers go in front of non-numerical values, and these numbers will be sorted in numerical order, while the non-numerical values will be sorted in lexicographical order.\r\n\r\nWhen I eventually start working on the new UI, I'll add more options for users to select their preferred sorting method."
