    "body": "I noticed that, if there are too much tabs opened (I know that is not a good way to proceed I hope you could forgive me) and you have to scroll the list, basically if the point on which you tap to scroll is the name of a tab, it will be selected after the scrolling ends.\n\nTo avoid it I started to tap on the name of a group when I would scroll to search if a tab is open (for instance) but I don't want to change the current tab.\n\nThis behaviour is evident on my iPhone and makes difficult to manage a long list of tabs on it, while on my iPad is not so noticeable but it is still here.",
