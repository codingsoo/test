        "body": "Hi, @buesing !\nThank you for your interest in Repomix!\n\nYes, it is possible to use Repomix as a Node.js library. There's actually a similar feature request that we're tracking here: #257.\n\nCurrently, you can use Repomix programmatically like this:\n\n```typescript\nimport { pack } from \"repomix\";\n\n// Basic usage\nawait pack(\"path/to/directory\", config);\n```\n\nHowever, I should note that the current library interface isn't as clean as we'd like it to be since it still heavily relies on console output through the logger system. We're planning to provide a more developer-friendly in the future with better interfaces and error handling."
