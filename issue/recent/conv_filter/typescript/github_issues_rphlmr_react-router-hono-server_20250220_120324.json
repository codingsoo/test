Deleted node_modules folder and re-installed dependencies.\n2. Install manually the dependency \"react-router-hono-server\".\n3. Try with different package managers.\n\nNevertheless, I keep getting this error, the server does not run and I can't find how to fix it.\n\nThanks in advance for any help.",
