I have a question about your comment:\n\n> The VAE for GS/RF/Mesh is trained for 750K, 500K and 290K steps, respectively\n\nDoes this mean that you are training a separate encoder for each of the 3 decoders? I was under the assumption that there is 1 shared encoder and 3 distinct decoders. But, if that is the case, I'm not sure how 3-stage training would look. My best guess would be that they train in this sequence:\n\n1. Train encoder + GS decoder for 750K steps\n2. Train RF decoder for 500K steps with fixed encoder\n3. Train mesh decoder for 290K steps with fixed encoder\n\nIs is something along these lines?"
