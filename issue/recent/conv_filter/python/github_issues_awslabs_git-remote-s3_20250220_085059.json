See 'git --help'.\r\n\r\nThe most similar command is\r\n        remote-fd\r\nfatal: remote helper 's3' aborted session\r\n``` \r\n\r\nBut it worked in a random python environment. \r\n\r\nAlso if I add the ./venv/Scripts that contains the git-remote-s3.exe to my Path, I can clone from anywhere, but it will probably stop working if I ever delete the python environment I took the git-remote-s3.exe from.
