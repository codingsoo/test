    "body": "Hello,\n\nIm currently trying to design binders for a complex composed of 3 subunits. To accelerate processing I delete one subunit and trim away parts of the structure of the remaining 2 subunits that are far away from the hotspot and do not interfere with binding of the binder. I successfully managed to design binders for one complex (4ic0) but for a homologous complex (6qgt) I can't get it to work. For some reason one subunit gets skipped during the process. So the output structure only contains subunit G (where the hotspot is on) but subunit B is missing, which probably causes binder design to the interface where subunit B should sit.\nSo far I tried using different trimmed structures as input and also the not trimmed structure (apart from deleting the 3rd subunit) and renaming the chains (don't now if the name of the chain even effects anything).\u00a0\n\nI am using these settings:\u00a0\nadvanved filters =default_4stage_multimer_hardtarget.json\nfilters = slightly adjusted version of the peptide_filters.json\nHowever all these settings worked fine on the first complex.\n\nDo you have an idea what causes this issue?\nKind regards",

When I was looking at your code, I was very interested in your filtering strategy, because we can't always find a suitable standard to filter the structures generated by AFD or RF+MPNN, so I carefully checked your weight file. I found that your weights for hotspot_RMSDhe Binder_RMSD are positive and usually large. Generally speaking, if the RMSD of the target structure in a trajectory is large, doesn't it mean that the prediction is not very reliable? The weight treatment in the code is a simple addition, so if the RMSD is large, will this cause the ranking of unreliable trajectories to rise?",

Note, the cosolidate and rank designs part will only start automatically once sufficient number of designs have passed the filters (100 by defualt). This can take a long time depending on your target size, generally you need to generate like 500-3000 trajectories to get 100 that pass the filters. However, if less is okay for you, then you can stop the design loop cell and just run consolidate and rank designs. You can also continue any time and consolidate again, the pipeline is designed in a way that you can always generate more designs and it does not \"break\" anything."
