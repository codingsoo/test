Does this line mean that I have inadvertently been training without image captions at all?\r\n\r\nIf so, how should I address this problem? Change my picture captions to _.caption_ or is there a setting that I need to change?\r\n\r\nThanks",

Since the beginning I've used the dataset specific argument and hard coded it as .txt\r\n\r\nLater someone pointed this out as they realised their .caption -files were never used, and I've since added the option to set the desired extension to the very first dataset node, still defaulting to .txt.\r\n\r\nSo in your case there's no need to worry, .txt has always worked. I've also added a console log line that states how many captions were loaded."
