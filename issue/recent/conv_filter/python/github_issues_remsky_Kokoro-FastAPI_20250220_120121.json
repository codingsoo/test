I'm not seeing that issue, though as mentioned in the readme, it's only been tested on Windows 11 w/WSL2 and the HuggingFace A100's for CUDA support + a Mac M3 for CPU (also may require a build from source for arm compatibility, though looking to add the multiplatform image shortly)\r\n\r\nAdded a note in the readme for linux users with this issue, feel free to modify it with a PR with any brief specifics I miss, so they can build from source with the config they'd want. \r\n\r\nbfe2dd522f5eef196973c2c95a0416bc314f17e4"

        "body": "Nice!\r\nThere might be a little catch with `add_group:` for users.\r\nIf numerical group id exists in container it is not added, so for me `video` group is the proper one on Gentoo. But it has id: 27 which is also id of `sudo` group inside image `/etc/groups`. Only when I specify id of group instead of it's name it is working great.\r\n\r\nOf course different systems / distros have different permissions / id's so there is no one proper way of doing this.\r\n\r\nIt might be worth mentioning that instead of tinkering with `docker-compose.yml` file it might be better to create `docker-compose.override.yml` and place changes there, so it will not conflict with further repo pulling.\r\n\r\nThank you for your support!"
