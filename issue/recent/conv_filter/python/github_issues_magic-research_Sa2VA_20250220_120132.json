I would like to clarify the SAV dataset details:\n\nYou mentioned about sam_v_full should be downloaded from meta/SA-V dataset page, which provides the link of downloading sav_000.tar - sav_055.tar; should we unzip them and put these files under sam_v_full directory as sub directories?\n\nThanks for your clarification!",
