    "body": "Hello, thank you for open-sourcing such an excellent work !\n\nBut when I run `sat/demo.ipynb`, an error will be reported at the line from `sat.model.base_model import get_model`, prompting that `sat.model cannot be found`. \nI see that there is indeed no model folder in the sat, and there is no `get_model` function in the `base_model` file. Is it because a file was uploaded missing?",

        "body": "Indeed, there seems to be a confusion over the `sat` reference. Here, `sat` points to the module in the environment, corresponding to `SwissArmyTransformer>=0.4.12` in the requirements. Have you executed `pip install -r requirements`? Feel free to comment here if you continue to face issues.\n\nTo avoid this confusion for more people, I may consider renaming the folder to `flashvideo`. Thanks for your feedback"
