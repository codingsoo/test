Additionally, I\u2019ve added a warning that non-password-protected files marked to \"keep indefinitely\" will only be deletable by an admin.\r\n\r\nIf you don\u2019t want to update, you can manually delete the files from the file system and edit the database. Note that only deleting the files from the file system will result in them still appearing in the app, but an error will be thrown if someone tries to download them."
