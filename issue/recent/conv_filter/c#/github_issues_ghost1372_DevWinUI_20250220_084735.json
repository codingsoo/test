Sorry I didn't mention, yes, I am using 8.0.0 preview 6 and I see a dozen of those same errors in the Immediate Window in VS and the app crashes without showing the main window.  When I reverted back to 1.7 exp 3, it was fine again.  Thanks!  (I am not using the source code directly, just the nuget packages)"

Is there a way I can get more info for you on that error short of sending source code, which I am not permitted to do?  Thanks!"

In a multi-window app, should a new ThemeService be created for each window and its settings set to the main application window's settings?  Or should the main window's ThemeService just call .Initialize() on the newly created window?\r\n\r\nAlso, what is the best method for applying changes to the settings (tint color, backdrop) to all open windows?  If the above answer is to create a separate TheemService for each window, should I just apply the settings to each window's ThemeService in a loop?\r\n\r\nThanks!",
