Due to #23, it does not reliably set up the 3 dependencies (xtl, xtensor, xsimd).\r\n\r\nTry the following in your command line manually:\r\n\r\n```\r\n# in numdot folder\r\ncd xtl/build && cmake ../ && cmake --install . --prefix .\r\n# back to numbot folder\r\ncd xsimd/build && cmake ../ -DENABLE_XTL_COMPLEX=1 -Dxtl_DIR='../xtl/build/ && cmake --install . --prefix .\r\n# back to numdot folder\r\ncd xtensor/build && cmake ../ -DXTENSOR_USE_XSIMD=1 -Dxtl_DIR='../xtl/build/' -Dxsimd_DIR='../xsimd/build/' && cmake --install . --prefix .\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis basically replicates what SConstruct is supposed to do."

I ended up resolving it by manually building the three dependencies as mentioned above, and then removed those subcommands from the SConstruct file before running it again.\r\n\r\nedit: we traced the issue to the fact that powershell doesn't recognize `&&` and deletes the tmp file (xtl.hpp for example) when that command fails."
