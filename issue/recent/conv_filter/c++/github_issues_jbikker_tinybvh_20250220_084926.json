    "body": "Hello Jacco,\n\nI am using tinybvh for raytracing meshes that represent the surface of a fluid. It works very well (and it is 5x to 10x faster than my naive AABB !)\n\nIn my usage case, there might be multiple bounces and refractions. So I have a question:\n \n- is it possible to ignore a specific primitive in the traversal ? For instance, when I raytrace my surface, each time I encounter an intersection with a facet (say f), I am launching a refracted ray, and I would like to ignore the intersections with f when intersecting this refracted ray with the mesh (for now I am moving the origin of the ray slightly along the facet's normal and it works, but it is not super elegant). Same thing for computing shadow rays.\n\nBest,\n-- Bruno\n",

        "body": "Hello Bruno,\n\nI am glad you find tinybvh useful! Depending on how many rays you need to trace, you may benefit from using ````::BuildHQ````, ````::Optimize```` and/or different BVH layouts: ````BVH4_CPU```` seems to be best for many ray distributions.\n\nThat being said: Offsetting a ray is in fact the commonly used solution to avoid self-intersections at t=0. However, the offset is typically not made along the normal, but in the ray direction. Ignoring a single primitive doesn't resolve all cases, e.g. when a hit is exactly on a shared edge.\n\nThe offset magnitude is best chosen as 1e-7 times the extent of the scene for float32. In some rare cases, for grazing rays offsetting in the ray direction is not sufficient. It can then be beneficial to lerp between an offset in the ray direction D and an offset along the normal N using ````sqr(dot(N,D))```` as the lerp factor.  "

At first glance it looks like this is because the copy of BVH8 is not a deep copy so its two structs holding the same pointer to bvh8Node and then it gets freed twice when bvh8 is destructed.",

        "body": "There is some information in the README.md, but not really a recommendation. This information should ultimately end up in the wiki. In short:\r\n\r\n* WALD_32BYTE is what the builders produce: a 2-wide BVH with a compact node layout. This is also the default for Intersect calls and should get you decent performance with no overhead caused by any BVH conversion or optimization.\r\n* If you expect to trace lots of rays, you can convert the 2-wide BVH into a ALT_SOA. This is a quick conversion; after this, tracing rays will be a bit faster. Run speedtest to get an idea of the speed benefit on your machine.\r\n* For even more rays, you can convert the 2-wide BVH to a 4-wide BVH (BVH4_BASIC), and then to a BVH4_AFRA. So, two conversions. This gets you the format that is currently the fastest option in tiny_bvh, at the expense of more conversion work.\r\n* If you're serious about performance, there is one more option. Convert to VERBOSE, then optimize the BVH. Convert it back to WALD_32BYTE. The optimized tree will be substantially better, and can still be converted to BVH4_AFRA. The optimization takes a while though - this will improve in a future version of the library, but it will never be free.\r\n\r\nOn the GPU other options exist. The basic GPU layout is AILA_LAINE, which is quickly obtained by converting WALD_32BYTE. Faster options (that take longer to convert to) are BVH4_GPU and the ultimate format, CWBVH. You will find that CWBVH is often not the fastest option for primary rays (which are very coherent) but it should do relatively well on reflected rays.\r\n\r\nHope this helps!"
